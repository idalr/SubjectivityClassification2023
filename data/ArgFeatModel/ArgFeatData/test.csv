0,"Meanwhile, European foreign ministers metto strengthen anti-terrorism coordination within the EU,and called for a stronger alliance with Arab states incombating jihadi networks",2
5,"The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said:""The threat is not only the onewe faced in Paris,butit is spreading in other parts of the world, starting from Muslim countries.""",2
1,Better coordination is undoubtedly neededto foil further attacks in Europe,0
0,"whereIslamist terrorists have struck in three capitals - Madrid, London and now Paris",2
1,Anti-terrorism raids in France and Belgium confirmthat the threat continues,0
1,"The Paris killers had links with networks across the Middle East, including in Yemen",0
1,So the needto share intelligenceto counter groupsthat themselves operateand communicate easily across borderscannot be disputed,0
1,A further illustration of this came,0
0,an Algerian national appeared before a Greek prosecutor on Monday over a possible link to a foiled Islamist plotto attack police in Belgium,2
1,It is logical for Europeto reach out to Arab countries,0
1,"The first victims of violent jihadism are, after all,to be found in the Arab world",0
1,"In the Middle East and north Africa, terrorists have targeted Muslims first and foremost",0
1,"It came as little surprisethat the Arab League secretary general, Nabil el-Araby -who has recently met Ms Mogherini- immediately declared his organisation's readinessto help European partners indealing with a dangerthat spans many regions",0
1,"It is, nevertheless, vitalthat such cooperation avoids the mistakes of the past",0
1,This is not a war of civilisations,0
1,It is a fight against a violent sectarian ideologythat finds breeding grounds in Europe's disenfranchised communities and in the killing fields of the Middle East,0
5,"Ms Mogherini is correct to statethat this is ""not an issue between Europe or the west and Islam""",2
1,"But this effort must give proper priority to precautions and standardsthat have, in the past, been all too often trampled upon",0
1,The global war on terror proclaimed in the aftermath of 9/11 involved measuresthat violated fundamental rights and international law,0
1,Western cooperation with repressive Arab states involved rendition flights and the outsourcing of torture,0
1,Many regimes usedrepressive methods and emergency legislation to crush dissent as muchasto track terrorists,0
5,Last month this system of abuses was detailed in the damning US Senate report on the secret CIA programmethat ran detention sites and organised the transfer of detainees with the cooperation of partner countries,2
1,some of which were in the Arab and Muslim world,0
1,Calling for an alliance between Europe and Arab countries in a renewed fight against terrorismis important,0
1,But it should not permit any amnesia aboutwherethis has led in the past decade,0
1,"In the Middle East and north Africa, many regimes continueto show complete disregard for basic human rights and legal procedures",0
0,-asthe recent flogging of a Saudi blogger has illustrated,2
1,"Only one country, Tunisia, can claimto have reached some form of stable democracy in the wake of the Arab spring",0
1,"Others are run by despots or by military juntas, as in Egypt, or have been caught in a spiral of anarchy, as in Libya",0
1,Human rights activists and civil society struggleto do their work under immense pressure,0
1,There are few checks and balances,0
1,Nor is there sufficient oversight of security forces conducting anti-terrorism efforts,0
1,asEuropeans reach out to these regimes,0
1,",they must beware of the pitfalls",0
1,"An alliance with authoritarian powers, madeblindly or naively,can too easily involve the abandonment of values, a dangerous sense of impunity and even indifference towards the worst abuses",0
1,It can also backfire,0
1,becauserepression in some Arab states has provoked fresh discontent and radicalisation,0
1,All these things have happened in recent years,0

1,"BUFFALO, N.Y  - Even a $50 million budget deficit in the Buffalo school district couldn't convince members of the Buffalo Federation of Teachersto cut down on their taxpayer-funded tummy tucks, breast lifts and nose jobs",0
4," school district spending on the unique benefit, known as a ""cosmetic rider"" on the insurance plan for union members, totaled $5.4 million in 2013-14, an increase of 4.1 percent from 2012-2013 and an increase of 9.5 percent from two years ago, according to public records information obtained exclusively by EAGnews",2
4,"As an indication ofjust how muchthe perk is being utilized, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,the average cost of rhinoplasty is $4,545,whilethe average cost of liposuction is $2,866",2
4,"A breast lift costs $4,207, on average",2
1," over 1,200 Buffalo teachersunion members could havehad a boob job last year, at taxpayer expense",0
1,"The annual expenditure is staggering, given the district's troubled financial situation,not to mention its sketchy academic performance",0
5,"In January 2014, the Buffalo News reportedthat the school district was grappling with a $50 million budget deficit for the 2013-14 school year",2
5,"""Thatgives us very little wiggle roomto fund anything new,""Barbara Smith, the district's chief financial officer, told the school board",2
1,"Except, of course, for a lot of new cosmetic medical procedures for teachers",0
1,"The ""cosmetic rider"" benefit has been offered to teachers for decades and has been scrutinizedonly recently due to the school district's financial plight",0
1,"The school board has been unwillingto impose a new labor agreement without the rider,asallowed by law",0
1,So the district has been operating under the terms of an old agreement -which includes the cosmetic rider-that expired about 10 years ago,0
1,"Untilthe union agrees to a new contract without the perk,the school district will continuepaying",0
1,That possibility has been discussed for years,0
1,the union has never budged,0
5,"""There'sno co-pay (for cosmetic procedures),sothe school district ends upfooting the entire bill,""The Atlantic reported in 2012",2
1,"Perhaps ifthe Buffalo school district produced great academic results, and studentswho were prepared for collegeor the working world upon graduation,taxpayers could justify such a cushy benefit for teachers",0
1,But that's clearly not the case,0
4,The district recently boastedthat its graduation rate improved from a miserable 47.8 percent to 56 percent,2
1,So slightly more than half of the students are now getting a diploma,0
1,which is hardly a reasonto celebrate,0
1,"The district's latest student proficiency numbers are ugly, as well",0
4,"According to the Buffalo News, only 12.2 percent of Buffalo students rated proficient or better on recent standardized English tests",2
4,whileonly 13.1 percent rated proficient or better in math,2
1,So whathas this teaching staff accomplished that merits a benefit as costly and wasteful as free cosmetic surgery?,0
0,"The June 2014 union newsletter - appropriately named The Provocator - includes ads from three cosmetic service providers pedaling procedures like Botox, cosmetic breast and body contouring, facelifts, hair transplantation, and ""medispa"" treatments",2
1,Those ads are boundto pay off for the providers,0
1,becausethe teachers can obtain their pricey services for free,0
1,"- at our expense, of course",0
1,There is a chancethat the cosmetic rider could finally be abolished through labor negotiations,0
0,an outside mediator proposedgiving teachers an 11.8 percent pay increase,2
0,"in exchange they would pay a ""small"" amount toward their own health insurance",2
5,"The proposal also calls forending the plastic surgery coverage,according to the Buffalo News",2
1,"Whilecompletely eliminating the ""cosmetic rider"" from its benefits packagewould not plug the $50 million budget hole",0
1,"the annual expense is an indicationthat the school board is not serious aboutreining in out of control spending, nor making sureevery dollar is going directly towards the education of children",0

1,The Fed enjoyed some successboosting U.S  growth,0
1,here are five reasonswhyQE won't work for the ECB,0
2,Eurozone Is Not a Country,2
1,The European Union does not have a large budget and issues few euro-denominated bondsthe ECB could purchase,0
1,"Instead, the ECB will haveto purchase individual country debt",0
1,"it isas ifthe Fed hadto purchase a basket of bonds issued by California, Iowa and other states",0
1,Markets for European bonds--both sovereign and corporate--and bank lending are highly fragmented along country lines,0
1," it is unlikelythat QE will have much effect on banks' willingnessto make new business loans in places buffeted by the financial crisis, like Spain and Greece",0
2,EU Has No Fannie Mae,2
1,QE seemsto work bestwhencentral banks inject capital directly into specific markets,0
0,The Fed purchased mortgage-backed securitiesthat significantly lowered interest rates on mortgages across America,2
1,Housing prices recovered much of the value lost during the financial crisis,0
0,new home construction rebounded,2
2,The EU has no analog to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,2
1,the ECB cannot readily purchase mortgage-backed securitiesto boost the European housing sector,0
1,Fiscal Policy Is Pulling in the Opposite Direction,0
0,"Europe's largest economy, Germany, recently accomplished a balanced budget for the first time since 1969",2
1,"austerity programs intendedto restore solvencyhave forced massive government spending cuts and tax increases in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean states",0
1,Those spending cuts--thoughessential to sorely needed structural reforms--will undercut the effects of any increased bank lendingECB bond purchase may induce,0
1,"With unemployment hovering at about 25 percent in Spain and Greece, and 13 percent in Italy, banks will remain skepticalthat lendingto expand businesseswill do muchto create bigger markets forwhatthey sell",0
1,QE DoesLittle to Fix Euro-Imposed Dysfunctions,0
1,"Althoughstructural reforms could make Greece,Italy and other high unemployment economies more attractive placesto build factories and establish businesses in the long run, governments in Athens, Rome and other capitals face voterswho need jobs now",0
1,And the cost of labor--though perhaps gradually falling--in these countries will remain too highto attract investment for many years,0
1,Mediterranean countries still had their own currencies,0
2,",those could let their currencies fall in value relative to those of northern European states",2
1,That would re-price laborto attract investment and jobs,0
1,"But the single currency, the euro, deprives them of that lever",0
1,"Thoughthe Europeans have a single currency,they lack common education standards and languagethat gives the United States a more or less single labor market",0
1,"In the absence of currency devaluation to re-price Mediterranean labor, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards cannot migrate to Germanywhereunemployment is only 5 percent, with the same easethat Americans have migrated to South Dakota and Texasto participate in the oil boom",0
1,"In the end, the EU and ECB lackswhatthe Fed enjoys--the punch of a national governmentthat ran large deficitsto augment its effortsto pull the U.S  economy outof recession and national credit, housing and labor marketsthat made monetary policies--like QE--reasonably effective",0
1,"The new Republican leadership in Congress has indicatedthat new, punitive measures against Iran might be among its first orders of business",0
1,even thoughdiplomatic talks with our international alliance are entering a promising new stage,0
1,my colleagues are serious aboutrestraining Iran's nuclear ambitions,0
1,they will resist the temptationto intervene and instead letour negotiators finish the job,0
1,Altering the terms or objectives of the talkswould amount tomoving the goalpostswhenthe end zone is in sight- with potentially devastating consequences,0
1,"November's four-month extension of the ""P5+1"" negotiations (called so because of the participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) confirmed both the difficulty of the remaining issues and the importance ofcontinuingto negotiate",0
1,We are still several steps short of a complete and lasting termination of Iran's nuclear weapons program,0
1,the current interim agreement between Iran and the international community - known as the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) - is a vast improvement over 18 months ago,0
0,Iran's nuclear program was still expandingand shrouded in secrecy,2
1,the JPOA is only a temporary agreement,0
0,Iran has complied with it and verifiably frozen and rolled back its nuclear program,2
1,demonstratingthat it is willingto take negotiations seriously,0
1,Congress could play an important oversight role,0
1,negotiators workto build on this progress and secure a verifiable and lasting nuclear agreement with Iran,0
1,acting peremptorilyto demand specific concessions from Irancould destabilize the diplomatic balance needed for negotiationsto both continue and ultimately succeed,0
1,"It would be unwise, for example,to lay out unrealistic or overly-specific requirements for a final agreementto be acceptable to Congress",0
1, the nuclear negotiating table is not the placeto compelIran to clean up its act on issues unrelated to nonproliferation,0
1,"Iran engages in an array of behaviorsthat the US and the international community find unacceptable, such aspersecuting political opponents and religious minorities, and supporting terrorist organizations like Hezbollah",0
1,we must not insistthat everything be solvedbeforeanything is solved,0
1,a nuclear agreement is and should be our first priority,0
1,such an agreement could facilitate progress on other fronts,0
1,"Imposing new or less flexible economic sanctions -which has been proposed by a number of my congressional colleagues, including Senators Kirk and Menendez- could do great damage to our prospects for a nuclear agreement with Iran",0
1,New punitive action could strengthen Iranian hard-liners and make their withdrawal from the negotiations more likely,0
1,"Acting unilaterally could also undermine the stability of our international alliance, and thereby actually weaken the existing international sanctions regime",0
1,"The existing sanctions are, of course, a major reasonthat Iran is at the negotiating table",0
1,Congress should stand readyto reimpose and strengthen them,0
1,shouldIran violate the terms of the JPOA or any future nuclear agreement,0
1,taking punitive action nowcould send a messagethat Congress does not stand behind the negotiators,0
1,"We cannot lose sight of the factthat a verifiable nuclear agreement with Iran would makeour country, Israel, the Middle East and the world much safer",0
1,The nuclear talks with Iran could still crumble under the pressure of opposition and distrust both inside and outside Iran,0
1,But the United States and the international community must press ahead ,0
1,becauseof the securitythat the removal of the nuclear threat would bringand the dire alternatives we'll faceifIt is increasingly apparentthat the U.S  war against Islamic extremism has been put on hold by President Obama and his national security team,0
0,President Obama failedto even mention Al Qaeda during his State of the Union address,2
1,"In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse ofwhatthe future of terrorism lookslike,andwhatthe civilized world will haveto defend against",0
1,"At the same time, the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S  partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a countrythat four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led effortsto defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)",0

1,it beganto supplant likeminded terrorist groups,0
0,"the Islamic State counted affiliates in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia",2
0,ISIL even has begunto make inroads in Yemen,2
0,"wherethe United States has been involved in effortsto degrade AQAP's capabilities,but have been unableto eliminate AQAP's abilityto conduct attacks on us and our allies",2
1,AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threatsAmerica currently faces,0
1,asthe recent attacks in Paris show,0
1,"In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror",0
1,"But without a change in our strategy, the task ofdefending against the triple threat of home grown extremism,jihadistswho have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria,and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible",0
0,"The Islamic State continues to recruit extremists in Europe, the Middle East, and as far away as southeast Asia",2
0,"using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languagesto spread their message around the world",2
1,"They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and tryto portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a meansto attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate",0
1,The United States and all civilized countries needto coordinate our effortsto fight the Islamic State first bycutting them off,0
1,"We must counter their message on social media;bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan;and ensurethat we prevent suspected terrorists fromtraveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen",0
1,"Perhaps most importantly, we haveto helpgovernments eliminate the safe havensthat the Islamic State relies onto gather strength",0
0,"Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failureto learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001",2
1,that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists,0
1,who will eventually turn their attention toward us,0
1,We also cannot affordto ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilitiesthat have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks,0
1,The U.S  government should implore American technology companiesto cooperate with authoritiesso that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communicationsaswe face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more thanwhatthey see on the Internet,0
1,"This year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will haveto extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act",0
1,I urge my colleaguesto consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism toolsour intelligence community relies onto keepthe American people safe,0
1,The challengewe face as free societiesisunlike anything we have seen in recent decades,0
1,"Aswe look at this moment in the long war against terrorism,it is encouragingto see Europeans aggressively movingto defend the continent following a horrific attack",0
1,But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraqto see the limitations of President Obama's current strategy,0
2,Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups,2
2,They also do not keepAmericans safe in the long term,2
1,The threat from Islamic extremism is only growing,0
1,"without greater leadership from the United States, I fearthat it will only be a matter of timebeforeinnocent Americans pay the ultimate price",0
1,we continueto underestimate our enemies and not develop a strategythat is commensurate to the threat,0

1,we can see your tell,0
1,several of your chosen turns of phrase have been usedto dehumanise and deny representation to gay people for decades,0
1,"""shove it in our face"", in particular,is tantamount to a coded gay slur",0
1,"For that matter, it is not even possibleto ""shove"" heterosexual sexuality in anyone's face",0
1,becausethere is no human on earthwhose faceisn't already completely submerged in and saturated by it,0
1,"Gratuitous straight sex is a defining plot device in pretty much all media: primetime soaps, daytime talk shows, beer commercials, Billy Crystal movies",0
1,We knowwhatyou meant,0
1," it's perfectly fineto be uncomfortable with overt displays of sexuality, regardless of orientation",0
2,everyone has the rightto set and defend their own sexual boundaries,2

1,there have been a stream of warnings about the health of the nation,0
1,"We are swallowing far more sugar, salt and fatthanis good for us- or the public purse",0
0,One warning came last Thursday,2
0,"whenOn Rock or Sand: Firm Foundations for Britain's Future was published, edited by John Sentamu, archbishop of York",2
1,"It tackles a range of issues spawned by a low-wage economy and refers to the current epidemic of obesitythat, for the first time in many decades, meansthat some children may live shorter lives than their parents",0
5,"On Rock or Sand rightly points outthat ""choice"" in diet is complex",2
1,"It is influenced by income, class, culture and societal pressure among myriad other drivers, not least the seductive practices of the marketplace indisguisingwhatgoes into processed foodand employing the hard sell in honeyed wordsthat are particularly effective on children",0
1,Low-cost food and medical progress have ensured longer lives,0
1,decades with a long-term condition can also bring misery,0
4,The book quotes Department of Health figuresthat show 62% of adultsand28% of children are overweight or obese,2
4,"The health problemsthis spawnsinclude type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease, betweenthem costing NHS England more than?5bn a year",2

1,It served up even scarier statistics,0
1,the rise in obesity is reversed,0
4,the cost to the NHS of diabetes alone will rise from ?10bn a year to an unsustainable ?17bn a year by 2035,2
5,the World Health Organisation recommendsthat 5% of our food energy should come from sugar,2

1,It is incrediblethat Merlin Entertainments should considerCoca-Cola a suitable sponsor for the London Eye,0
5,"As this paper reports, John Middleton, vice-president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, says:""Coca-Cola is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and diabetes.""",2
1,The second imperative is for government to wake up to the scale of the health disaster on its doorstep,0
0,"In February 2010, David Cameron laid out his vision for ""a new age of government""",2
5,"""Ifyou combine this very simple, very conservative thought -go with the grain of human nature- with all the advances in behavioural economics,""he said,""I thinkwe can achieve a real increase inwellbeing... withoutnecessarily havingto spend a lot of money.""",2
1,Money has certainly been tight,0
1,"even aspublic health issues, supporting improved wellbeing, have disastrously dropped off the agenda, issues such as plain packages for cigarettes, minimum pricing on alcohol and an end to selling sports fields",0

1,"The lack of investment in prevention, married to politicians' fear of the charge of ""uber-interference"" and ""the nanny state"", meansthat multinationals have too little restraint",0
1,"We acceptthe so-called nanny state edicts on seat belts, smoking and drink",0
1,whycan't the state take a much greater role inimproving the foodthat is sold to us and marketed to our children?,0
5,"Andy Burnham calls this ""finger wagging""",2
1, it is lifesaving,0
1,"It is welcomethat Burnham has promisedthat Labour will legislateto reduce the sugar, fat and salt in foods sold to children",0

1,It makes sense,0
1,Advertising to children is another issue requiring intervention,0
1,Promoting unhealthy products is restricted on children's television,0
1,"it is unfettered online in ""advergames"" and between 8pm and 9pm on television",0
5,"when,according to Malcolm Clark of the lobbying group, the Children's Food Campaign (CFC), ads are a junk food paradise",2
1,Burnham intendsto ask the committee on advertising practice and the Advertising Standards Authorityhowchildren can be better protected,0
1,That is a cop-out,0
5,"The CFC, backed by the British Heart Foundation, has rightly proposeda body independent from the advertising industryto monitor and regulate marketing to children and tougher enforcements",2

1,"The truth isthat the pope - a charismatic and decent-seeming guywhose fingeris a good deal closer to the people's pulsethanhis predecessor's was- is tying himself in knots tryingto appear ""modern"" at the same time asadhering to official teaching",0
1,And it simply won't wash,0
1,The church has been peddling a nonsense on contraception for almost 50 years,0
1,"The vast majority of us church-going,""faithful"" Catholics have voted with our gonads and ignored it, and at some point (soon, please!)Rome is goingto haveto admitit has been wrong,andthat the ""contraceptive culture"" is not about a lack of respect for human life",0
1,"it's quite simply about a sensible realisationthat most couples can raise two, three or four children better, in every way,thanthey can raise 10, 11 or 12",0
1,"But aha,the pope would say,hereI am being a cultural colonialist, seekingto impose my first-world notions on those of a developing communitythat has a very different perspective",0
1,"actually, no I'm not",0

1,Israel has made the cut despite fervently denying possession of a nuclear arsenal,0
1,"The spectacle is unfolding at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the main judicial organ of the United Nations",0
5,"A recent New York Times article on the Marshall Islands' ""near-Quixotic venture"" quotes Phon van den Biesen, head of the country's legal team, on the ultimate aim of the effort: ""All the nuclear weaponsstates are modernising their arsenals instead ofnegotiating[to disarm],andwe wantthe court to rule on this.""",2
1,The Islands' move might come off as more than a bit incongruous given its established existence as a pillar of the US-Israeli axis in UN forums,0
1,"Glance at any review of General Assembly votes on Israel/Palestine issuesandyou'll findthe Marshall Islands regularly represented in the exclusive anti- Palestine camp, along with a smattering of other obscure Pacific atolls",0
1,"The factthat justice in Palestine continuesto be as elusive as ever,despite nominal support from an overwhelming majority of countries, underscores both the general futility oftaking on the powersthat beas well as the frequent toothlessness of rulings emanating from UN institutions",0

0,"Lexical fallout aside, other US contributions to Marshallese culture include the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll",2
1,which continuesto generate revenue for US corporations,0
1,The widespread territorial displacement necessitated by the previous era of fanatical nuclear testing meanwhile highlights the irony of Marshallese government support for the US-funded entitythat displaces and otherwise oppresses Palestinians,0
1,human beings are contradictory creatures,0
1,nations composed of lots of human beings are thus inevitably also contradictory,0
1,"But inassessing the prospects for the Islands' foray into the International Court of Justice,it's worthtaking the contradictions into account",0
5,"The New York Times points outthat the court case ""comesasnuclear arms are increasingly being linked to other pressing international issues"" such as climate change ",2

1,large numbers of Democrats in Congress run away from a president with bad poll numbers,0
1,Republicans can put the president on the defensive for the remainder of his time in office,0
1,Major defections by Senate Democrats will also allow the Republican majority in the Senateto stop filibusters and potentially override Obama's vetoes,0
1,"The issues at stake range from construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to effortsto change and repeal Obamacare, as well as undo immigration reform, financial regulation, the opening of new relations with Cuba and new limits on greenhouse gases",0

0,The Keystone XL pipeline is the one instancein which Pfeiffer acknowledgesthat veto may haveto be used in the first place,2
1,But he does not expect such a moveto hurt the president's revival in the polls,0
5,"It is an issue,Pfeiffer argued, often cited by Republicanswho don't like the president anyway",2

5,Pfeiffer tiesthe president's rising popularity to the success of his economic policies but also to the Republican Party's difficulties with any voter not in the Koch brothers' tax bracket,2
5,"""TheGOP has huge trouble on cultural affinity,""said Pfeiffer",2
5,"""Republican tax policies, opposition toregulating pollution,their effortto repeal Dodd-Frank - it all favors the rich...We needto engage them on all that.""",2

5,"Pfeiffer told the New York Times in advance of the State of the Union speech,the nation's economic resurgence under President Obama creates ""a Chicken Little problem [for Republicans]-- allthe doom and gloomthey predicteddid not cometo pass.""",2
1,"The president crowed about ""good news, people"" in the State of the Union speech",0

5,"""....So the verdict is clear.Middle class economics works...andthese polices will continueto work as longaspolitics don't get in the way.""",2
1,Pfeiffer and other top administration officials thinkthey can further improve their poll numbers bygetting Republicansto debate the president's new proposals for increasing wages for working Americans,0
1,Good news in foreign policy is also possible,0
1,"unlike most second-term presidents, Obama is not abandoning the domestic agenda",0
5,"Obama's poll numbers will not decide the 2016 race for the White House,Pfeiffer said,becausethe ""biggest factor is the popularity of the nominee.""",2

0,"Brownie points were awarded for any period of incarceration,be it in a prison cell or psychiatric facility",2
1,Mal's age alone was enoughto earn him a significant amount of street cred in our misfit group of teenage boys,0
1,it was his history of extreme violencethat ensuredhis approval rating was sky high,0
0,"He was not just an incredibly violent man, but apparently belonged to a group of them",2
1,This madehim even more attractive,0

0,we soughtto consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes,2
0,I didn't findit at all oddthat a man pushing 30 was interested inhanging out with a bunch of delinquent teens,2

1,"For Armenia, its role as a reliable partner and ally of Russia has never faced any real challenge",0
1,Much of this reliance on Russia stems from essential security and economic concerns,0
1,"Armenia's security reliance on Russia is driven by a virtual state of war withneighbouring Azerbaijan,rooted in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, only exacerbated by the absence of ""normal"" diplomatic relations and closed border with Turkey",0
1,"And with the Turkish refusalto recognise the Armenian genocide,this threat perception is only magnified",0
1,"For small, landlocked Armenia, a strategic alliance with Russia is generally accepted as essential in the face of such inherent insecurity",0
1,"And beyond an imperative of security, Armenia also depends on Russia as a crucial source of remittances,ormoney sent home by large numbers of Armeniansliving and working in Russia",0
1, there is a surprisingly intense debate now under way within Armeniathat seriously questions these fundamental pillars of the Armenian-Russian relationship,0
1,"More specifically, this new challenge to Armenia's traditional reliance on Russia is driven by two significant factors: tragedy and timing",0
1,A tragedy first triggered this turnabout,0
0,"whena rogue Russian soldier killed an entire Armenian family,save for a six-month-old infant",2
0,"who later died of his stab wounds, in Gyumri, Armenia",2
2,Gyumri is the country's second-largest city and the host of the Russian military base,2
0,"That senseless act of random violence in the early morning hours of January 12, sparked an immediate and spontaneous outpouring of grief and mourning",2
1,But the initial shock and grief quickly turned to outrage,0
1,Russian military officials seemedto take charge of the case with a heavy-handed disdain and disregard for local sensitivities,0
1,That perception was only deepenedwhenArmenian officials were slowto respond or react,0
1,"It was this mishandling of the tragedy,even more than the murder itself, that then triggered a series of demonstrations and protests by local Armenians in Gyumri",0
0,"Fearingthat the Russian conscript would be moved from his detention within the Russian base and likely returned to Moscow,local residents demandedthat the self-confessed soldier be turned over to Armenian authorities",2
0,"For its part,local Armenian officials and the prosecutor general scurriedto calm tensions byfirst announcingthat Armenian investigators were actively participating in the interrogation of the soldier,andthen,oncethat did littleto appease the protesters,vowedthat the soldier would be tried in Armenia",2
1,"Amid the Armenian officials' wrangling over the legal process of the case, the absence of any higher level Armenian officials, and the failure of the Armenian presidentto declare a day of mourning or even make a statement,only escalated the tension",0
0,"And days later,no Armenian official attended the funeral of the murdered family",2
0,"therebytriggering a fresh wave of indignant protests in the city,that later spread to the capital, Yerevan",2
0,The protests soon moved to the Russian consulate in Gyumri beforeculminating in a march on the Russian base,2
0,asprotesters broke through a police cordonto enterthe base itself,2
1, there is a deeper context to this public anger,0
1, that family is only the latest victim in murders and shootings by Russian servicemen stationed at the Russian military base,0
0,"In 1999, two drunk Russian soldiers opened fire on a local market in the city,killing two and injuring dozens of others",2
0,"And in 2013, two children were killed by unexploded ordnance on an unguarded tank firing range on the premises of the Russian base",2
1,"Against this backdrop, the tragedy has also raised renewed questions of base security, with outragethat the armed soldierwho reportedly deserted his posttriggered no notice or alarm by Russian military personnel at the base",0
1,Althoughthis tragedy has prompted a new challenge to Armenian-Russian relations,0
1,"it is also exacerbated by a second factor, timing",0
1,"The timing of this tragedy could not be much worse, for several reasons",0
0," in 2013,in whatmany perceived as Russian pressure on its so-called ""strategic partner"",Armenia was forcedto scrap its planned free trade deal with the European Union in favour ofjoining the Russian-led Eurasian Union",2
1, a steady supply of arms and advanced weapons systems to Azerbaijan from Russia has sowed further distrust,0
1,"And most recently, the negative impact on the Armenian economy from western sanctions imposed on Russia, evident in a sudden depreciation of the Armenian currency and reflected in a steep decline in remittances, has only revealed the asymmetry and lack of parity in Armenia's ""partnership"" with Russia",0
1,It seems clearthat this unexpected challenge to Armenia's reliance on Russia will not dissipate any time soon,0
1,"Pulling, Sharon Horgan's sitcom about three venal women in Penge, south London, was so goodit gotyou evangelical",0

1,This kind of double standards performs a variety of insidious functions for the French state,0
1,"It usesthe language of ""terrorism"" to demoniseits political enemies and ""free speech"" to immunise its political friends",0
1,"It merges the criminalisation of anti-Semitism with strong criticisms of Israel along with any advocacy of boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS)",0

1,it allows neither thenit is choosingto protect the sensibilities of minorities and others,0
1,whose dignityis under attack,0
1, there are many compromisesthat can be madeto ensure maximum freedom of expression whileacknowledging certain limits,0
1,"The US Supreme Court long ago decidedthat free speech does entitle someoneto yell ""fire"" in a crowded theatre",0
1,This iswhatcourts are for,0
1,"to draw these lines in specific cases, balancing opposing truths in the light of practicality and the evolving values of the community",0
1,Whata judicial body hadto say about race or homosexualitya century ago is different thanwhatit says today,0
1,aswe in the US know too well,0
1,the prevailing ideology among the justices is often of greater importance todetermininghowsuch lines are drawnthanare the legislative or constitutional enactments being interpreted,0
1,"In some respects, then, such determinations are more part of the problem than of the solution",0
1,"I findmyself siding with the abstract sentiments of Pope Francis, but with Rushdie's view ofminimising the role of law and the state",0
1,we impose limits by way of government,0
1,we are entering the domain of censorship,0
1, we needto protect individuals and groups against malicious forms of defamation and hateful attacks on identities withoutconfusing such protection with effortsto channel public awareness in certain prescribed directions,0
0,"My own experience suggeststhat ""freedom"" of this sort has been used by some pro-Zionist and pro-Israeli organisationsto discredit and deterandcriticism of Israel, and especially of Israeli state crimes victimising the Palestinian people",2
1,"In Rushdie's case we needto protect his rightto publish ""The Satanic Verses"",whilecondemning the fatwaimposing a death sentence for blasphemy and apostasy,yet upholding the right of non-western political communitiesto prohibit distribution of such a book because of its provocative nature in certain civilisational settings",0
1,"Obviously, there are no cookie cutter answers",0
1,"The proper limits are a matter of history, ethics, cultural priorities, and circumstances",0
1,I feelthat the central question is raised by Derrida's inquiry intohowwe can learnto live together,0
1,"For me,living together,given the originality of our historical moment, involves the construction of overlapping political communities of destiny - from family to world, with a major focus on the national political community combined with a greater effortto establish a global political communityso that challenges posed by climate change, nuclear weaponry, infectious disease, and world poverty can be addressed more effectively and humanely",0
1,The expected congressional vote on a new sanctions bill against the Iranian regime has rekindled debate over Tehran's nuclear defiance and the best wayto confront it,0
1,"Congress has misgivings about a rogue regime intent onobtaining nuclear capability,andunderstandably wantsto ensurethat Washington does not strike a bad deal",0
1,Some arguethat a decisive approach toward Tehran will be counterproductive,0
1,But their position ignores historical lessons and stands on a number of mythsthat needto be debunked,0
1,More sanctions on Iran will prompt the regimeto unilaterally walk away from the talks,0
1,Iran cannot affordto walk away,0
1,becauseit is desperate and vulnerable,0
1,It has a genuine interestto secure the lifting of existing sanctions,0
1,which provided the initial impetus for the regimeto talk,0
1," too, cynics arguedthat sanctions would promptTehran to accelerate its nuclear activities",0
1,"The regime is playing a game of attrition, aimingto weakenU.S  resolve, win more concessions, and maintain its nuclear infrastructure",0
1,The bipartisan sanctions bill will forceTehran to consider speedy compliance,0
5,"This month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated,""Breakingthe anti- Iran sanctions is the only wayto achieve national progress,""acknowledgingthat Iran's devastated economy cannot endure the weight of further sanctions, especially after the recent decline in oil prices",2
1,The mullahs are paranoid of a disenchanted population already on edge,0
1,"With rampant unemployment, inflation, and loss of oil revenues,walking away from the talksis not an option",0
1,especially ifa sanctions-in-waiting bill is hovering over their head,0

4,more money is being funneled into Syria and Iraqto execute Tehran's designs - a budgetthat is twice that of all the country'spublically funded universities combined,2
1,sanctions failto forceTehran to abandon key parts of its nuclear program after over a year of negotiations,0
1,continued talks with no additional leverage will fail as well,0

1,I know the real civil rights story,0
0,I've written two best-selling histories of the period,2
1,The greatest social movement of the last century belongs to all Americans,0
1,But some people preferto play racial games,0
1,This movie fits in with the racially divisive discussion aboutwho owns the history of the civil rights movement,0
1,It fits withpolarizing racial figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton,0
1,They regularly exploit the history of the civil rights movement for their own personal gain ,0
1,hosting television shows and getting money from corporations,0
1,"whilenot doing the hard work ofaddressing high rates of black crime, school dropouts and family breakdown",0
1,It is also fits with many white politicians,0
1,who blame the poor for every problem and findit easyto push minority voters out of their districtswhileignoring the nation's history ofdenying black peoplethe right to vote,0
1,Now a version of the same race hustle is on display in Hollywood,0
1,"To celebrate King as a hero,the director,who is blackdecidedto make President Lyndon Johnson into a white villain",0
0,"In one scene Johnson erupts inanger at Dr  King,telling the civil rights leader,""You've got one big issue,I've got one hundred and one.""",2
5,"Peoplewho were in the room,black and white aides to the president and Dr  King, sayno such confrontation ever happened",2
0,The movie also has Johnson approving of FBI Director J  Edgar Hoover's schemeto send Dr  King's wife an audio recording of her husband having sex with another woman,2
1,The historical record is clear,0
1,"Yes, the tape is real",0
1,"No, Johnson had nothingto do it",0
1,And the tape had nothingto do with events in Selma,0
5,"All of that iswhatBill Moyers called""the worst kind of creative license suggesting the very opposite of the truth.""",2
0,"the director, DuVernay, was called on the distortion,she saidpeoplewho care about historyare the problem",2
5,"She arguedthat crediting Johnson withsupporting the Selma marchwas ""jaw-dropping and offensive""and amounted toignoring ""black citizenswho made it so.""",2
1,"To her, the factthat Johnson explicitly endorsed the idea oftaking the movement to Selma in a recorded phone call to Dr  Kingis just a nuisance",0
1,White directors have similarly distorted civil rights history,0
0,"The 1988 film ""Mississippi Burning"" featured two heroes, both white and both FBI agents",2
1,That was an incredible distortion of a story about the bravery of civil rights workerswho daredto go southto stand with beleaguered black heroes against racial oppression,0
1,"In truth, the FBI was often in league with local police departments incovering up racially motivated murder",0
0,In 1988 that distortion was rationalized as a smart box office decisionto offer white heroes to white audiences,2
1,"Now that a black director has a chanceto make Hollywood's first big movie about Dr  King,she sees it as time for payback and her own brand of distortion",0
1,"Race retains a powerful grip on American guilt, fear, lust and anger",0
1,That'swhycontrolling the narrativeis so important,0
1,"And the key to the narrative is in the facts of slavery, legal segregation and the fight for equal rights",0
1,That iswhyfacts about Dr  King are subject to a constant power struggle,0
1,DuVernay is sayingshe will tell her story as a black story for black audiences with a black hero,0
1,she will twist factsasshe pleases,0
5,"Mark Twain said:""Get your facts first,thenyou can distort them as muchasyou please.""",2
1,The facts arethat mostly white students went south for Freedom Summer,0
1,white ministers and rabbis took great risks and even died for the cause,0
0,white government officials like John DoarandNicholas Katzenbach put themselves between racist mobs and black people,2
1,None of this diminishes the contributions of black people,0
1,The truth isthat President Johnson workedto makethe movement a success,0
0,The president famously brought tears to Dr  King's eyes in 1965whenhe told a joint session of Congress and a television audience of 70 millionthat every American should stand up for equal voting rights,2
5,"""Theircause must be our cause, too,""the president said",2
5,"""Becauseit's not justNegroes,butit's really all of uswho must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.""",2
5,"in a rhetorical crescendo, the president said:""And we shall overcome.""",2
1,He used a phrasethat told the nationhe was on the side of civil rights for black people,0
1,"As the author of a history of the civil rights movement, ""Eyes on the Prize -- America's Civil Rights Years,"" I've done enough researchto knowthat any fair account of the great social movement hasto acknowledge Lyndon Baines Johnson as a civil rights hero",0

1,"Following the Paris attacks, there appearsto be a consensusthat France has experienced a turning point in its modern history",0
1,Most commentators place an emphasis on the possible roleexternal factors have played in this act of terrorism,0
1,Various external factors are cited,0
1,"they mostly focus on the conflicts in the Middle East and international tensions in general, in a bidto link the Paris attacks to extremist ideologiesthat promote such murderous acts",0
1,"A week after the attack, the French political class and key media outlets remain focused on the security aspect and barely attemptto address the issue from a different angle",0
1,They do not question the responsibility held by French society and state - as well as the role of the socioeconomic policies practised by successive French governments - inaddressing the woes of the socially marginalised and disenfranchised zones fromwhich the Kouachi brothers sprang,0
1,"Howcan this act be attributed only to dogmatic ideological motivations and grievances over international conflicts, giventhat the religious and ideological indoctrination process is too complicatedto be attributed solely to external factors?",0
1,Asboth French officials and analysts respond with emotion,0
1,they ignore a series of socioeconomic factorsthat have fuelled the motivations of the actors,0
1,"It is importantto rememberthat the perpetrators of the attack were born and raised in France in a poor, disadvantaged area",0
4,whereunemployment rates among the youth aged 18 to 24 years reaches 45 percent (compared to the national ratewhich is nearly 10 percent),2
1,"In these areas, called""banlieues"",state infrastructure is almost non-existent and the population is subject to segregation and racial discrimination in terms of access to employment opportunities and housing",0
1,which in most cases leads to exclusion from the civic sphere,0
4,"In 2006, an official case study focusing on access to employment conditions showedthat 51 percent of young French candidates are subject to discrimination based on ethnic origin and/or skin colour",2
1,These conditions result in social marginalisation and promote delinquency,0
1,which in turn raises the chances of incarceration,0
5,"Sociologist Robert Castel describes the situation of young people in these deprived areasasfollows:""These young people are not completely [living] outside of society,however, they are not inside it either,forthey do not enjoy any recognised space/role [...]Their situation is pretty paradoxical:they are citizens,who live on French territory,andyet they undergo differential and discriminatory treatmentthat disqualifies them.The republic, in contradiction with its own principles, seems incapable ofintegrating these young French peoplewho live like the indigenous minority of the nation.""",2
1,"This, combined with a conflicting social contextthat is constantly fuelled by debates over identity,religion and behavioural issues (such as the debate on national identity, the veil, halal food in schools, Islam and French secularism) further stigmatise this community and place it in a permanent state of confrontation with the rest of society",0
1,This vicious cycle prevents any change in the dynamics of this relationship into a cooperative onethat could help find solutionsin orderto improve their socioeconomical status,0
1,"Young people are depicted in a caricaturist form, makingit all the more difficultforthem to socially and professionally integrate",0
1,which deepens their sense of marginalisation,0
1,"Such dynamics only complicate the relationship with the government, often seen as an opponent and sometimes as an enemy",0
1,This is the gapwherereligious indoctrination factors sneaks in - oftenoccurring in prison environments,0
0,whereethnic groups are predominantly from these areas,2
4,where18- to 30 -year-olds represent 35 percent of the incarcerated population,2
1,Are these good enough reasonsto explain the motives behindcommitting such a terrorist act?,0
1,Of course not,0
1,But the conditions described above constitute the factorsthat facilitate and accelerate the ideological and religious indoctrination process,0
1,"Especially whenprotagonists have the financial resources(this is often the case)to attract the most fragile, the most helpless and the most excluded in orderto step forward and enrol in extremist activities",0
1,the international context helps,0
1,"With such a grim reality, the question going forward would beifpurely security measures are sufficientto challenge the terrorismthat threatens France",0
0,"We expectedto find an answer to this question in Prime Minister Manuel Valls's speech at the National Assemblyin which he outlined ""exceptional"" measuresto be taken",2
5,"""Franceis at war against terrorism and against radical Islam,""he said",2
5,"""Exceptional measures will be takento challenge terrorism.""",2
0,"Valls mentioned exclusively security measures, such asreinforcing supervision within the prisonswhereIslamist prisoners are concentrated;establishing inter-European border controls;strengthening international intelligence cooperation",2
0, there was no mention of a possible revision of the government's social policiesto address the problems in the marginalised zones; no announcement of a reflection on a possible serious debateto propose a new approachto address all the socioeconomic illsaffecting them,2
1,"The security measures announced by the prime minister are necessary, but not sufficientto contain terrorism",0
1,"the roots of extremism,wherethe first frustrations are formed,remain untouched",0
1,That is notto saythat the French government should be solely heldresponsiblefor the situationwhich France is facing today,0
1, failingto take intoaccountthe catastrophic socioeconomic factor would be tantamount topromoting the very contextthat contributes to the development of fundamentalist ideologies,0
1,The government urgently needsto review its social and economic policies towards these disadvantaged areas,0
1,"developing real socioeconomic infrastructure, strengthening solidarity, emphasising the fight against discrimination in employment and housing, strengthening anti-racist laws and promoting a fairer media discourse towards these populationsin orderto improve their lot in life",0
1,This will undoubtedly contribute towardssterilising any nicheswhereextremist ideology can take root,0

0,It seemed like the perfect victimless crime,2
0, we were stealing from chain storesthat had plenty more,2
1,it seems ludicrousthat it ever felt so normal,0
1,Whathappened to us?,0
1,We weren't stealing through need,0
0,most of us got pocket money from our parents and had more than enough clothesto wear,2
1,"Maybe it was that particularly hot summer, or the pressure of our looming GCSEs",0
1,Or maybe we were greedy little consumerists with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement and no moral compass,0
1,Who knows?,0

4,"In Ferguson, Missouri, 50 of the 53 police officers are white in a citythat is two-thirds African American",2
4,"In Connecticut's state capital,Hartford, 66% of the police department is white",2
4,only 16% of the residents are,2
1,"And these are just two examples: despite progress over the past 50 years,many police departments remain predominantly white in cities and towns",0
4,wherethe majority of the population is nonwhite,2
1,There are some important exceptions to the disparity pattern,0
4,"Several big city police departments are majority-black or majority-Hispanic (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Santa Fe and El Paso, for instance)",2
1,whileothers (such as Chicago) are so diversethat no single group comprises the majority,0
1,"Yet for many other cities, the gap between the complexion of the police department and the local population is huge",0
1,Whydoes this matter?,0
1,Do police officers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds act differentlywhileon the job?,0
1,Do they have different kinds of relationships with minority communities?,0
1,Aren't all officers trainedto do their jobs similarly and to treat all civilians the same regardless of race?,0
1,"Research showsthat, in general in the US, there is not a strong correlation, let alone a causal relationship, between an officer's raceandhowofficers treatmembers of the publicwhenthey respond to calls from civilians or stop and question them on the streets Statistics",0
1,"are, of course, not predictive of individual behavior",0
1,studies of specific departments or communities vary,0
4,"A 2004 study in Indianapolis (Indiana) and St  Petersburg (Florida) by Ivan Sun and Brian Payne, for example, foundthat black officers were more likely than white officers working in black neighborhoodsto provide information, referrals to other agencies, and to treat residents respectfully",2
4,althoughthe black officers were also more likelyto use physical force against citizens in conflict situations,2
0," again, most studies find similarities overall in police behavior irrespective of officers' racial background",2
1,"Shared training in the academy, as well as on-the-job socialization by fellow officers, results in more similarities than differences among officerswhenit comes to their policing activities,including similarities inhowofficers of all races treat whiteversus non-white citizens",0
1,So we should not view racial diversification on the force as a panacea forimproving police treatment of minorities,0
1,minority officers adopt majority attitudes about thosethey serve and protect,0
1,it might hardly help at all,0
4,"A 2008 study in Baltimore, Maryland by Peter Moskos documented precisely this shared mentality among both white and black officers",2
1,But it can pay major dividends in other ways,0
4,"In one poll of 1,791 Americansthat I and a colleague conducted for our book, Race and Policing in America,more than 70% of blacks, Hispanics and whites in the United States believedthat a city's police department should have a similar racial composition to the city",2
4,The same study foundthat very few blacks and Hispanics (only 5%) want most officerswho work in their neighborhoodsto be exclusively of the same race as the residents,2
4,instead most people preferto see racially-mixed teams of officers patrolling their streets,2
1,"Importantly, such diversity can helpto build trust and confidence in the police",0
1,"the morea police department reflects the composition of the local population,the higher the department's reputation among residents",0
1,"which can provide a foundationto build further trust,coupled with other needed reforms",0
1,"It also helps, in majority-black or majority-Hispanic cities,ifthe chief of police comes from that community as well because, as the public face of the department,he or she can allay suspicions",0
1,whencontroversial incidents occur in a waythat white police chiefs may not be ableto do,0
1,A diverse police force can also helpto decrease the sensethat individuals are being stoppedand questioned solely because of their race,0
1,This clearly applieswhenthe officers and citizens are of the same race,0
1,even encounters between white officers and minority citizens may be perceived as less racializedwhenthe department has a critical mass of minority officers,0
1,"A representative police force can, in other words, have symbolic benefitsthat enhance the overall status of a police department and also reduce the perceptionthat actions, such as stops or searches, are based on racial profiling",0
1,Most police chiefs realize the advantages of a departmentthat represents the local community,0
1,there are big challenges inrecruiting more minority officers,0
1,"Many Hispanics and African Americans are reluctantto consider a career in law enforcement - not surprising, given the history ofpolicing in America coupled with more recent events",0
1,Highly-publicized incidents like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York only makeit more difficult for police departmentsto recruit minority officers,0
1,"Recruiters can have some success,however,ifthey broaden their outreach effortsto include churches and community centers - andifthere are pre- existing positive relationships between the police and residents in those minority neighborhoodswherecommunity policing has already taken root",0
1,which can be built on,0
4,"Althoughtroubled interactions between minorities and police garner most of the headlines,there are neighborhoods in American citieswhereworking-class and middle-class black and Hispanic residents - including youths - have better relationships with the authorities than on average,asI found in a study of Washington DC neighborhoods",2
1,It is in these communitiesthat the police can enhance their recruitment efforts and achieve at least some success,0
1,Racial diversification is one crucial ingredient in a larger program of reformthat is requiredto improve police departments throughout the country,0
1,A representative police force is not a panacea,0
1,"it is a positive reform, and an achievable one",0
1,It is no secretthat Russia views the South Caucasus asbeing in its natural sphere of influence,0
1,"In light of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on the back of Moscow's recent treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgians have legitimate reasonsto believethat Russian activity in their country will only increase in 2015",0
1, many are keeping a close eye on the Georgian province of Samtskhe-Javakheti-a majority ethnically Armenian region located just three hours' drive from the nation's capital city of Tbilisi,0
1,Causing instability in Samtskhe-Javakheti would achieve two goals for Moscow,0
1, it would further dismember the territorial integrity of Georgia,0
0,The Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are already under Russian occupation,2
1,By some accounts they are closer than ever tobeing annexed by Moscow,0
1,"An independent Samtskhe-Javakheti, or one under Russian influence, would divide Georgia down the middle",0
1,Armenian separatism in Samtskhe-Javakheti might not be as vocalasit was only a few years ago,0
1,there is still a fearthat Moscow could easily reenergise separatist movements in the region,0
1,"Secondly, and more importantly for Russia, bringing the region under Moscow's influencewould make a land corridor between Russia and Armenia, via South Ossetia, one step closer",0
1,This is important,0
0,becauseRussia maintains a sizeable military presence in Armenia,2
4,"The bulk of the Russian force is based in the city of Gyumri and consists of approximately 5,000 soldiers and dozens of fighter planes and attack helicopters",2
1,Russia has long had the difficult challenge ofsupplying these forces,0
0,especially sinceGeorgia and Turkey refuse transit rights,2
1,This has left a reliance on Iran,0
1,"which for obvious reasons, is not ideal for Russia",0
1,"It is not only for Russiathat Samtskhe-Javakheti is strategically important, but also for Europe",0
0,"The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus Pipeline,carrying oil and gas respectively from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea,passes through the province",2
1,the possibility of more Central Asian oil and gas finding its way to Europe becomes likely,0
1,these pipelines bypassing Russia will become a vital part of Europe's energy security,0
0," the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway,which is dueto open later this year,passes through Samtskhe-Javakheti",2
1,It is expectedthat this rail line will eventually transport 3 million passengers and over 15 million tons of freight each year,0
1,There is a perfect storm brewing in the region,0
1,Russia wantedto exploit the situation in Samtskhe-Javakheti,0
1,it could not ask for better timing than now,0
1,First is the factthat many Javakheti Armenians have Russian sympathies,0
4,"Until its closure in 2007, the Russian military base there was the single biggest source of employment",2
0,It has also been reportedthatMoscow is issuing Russian passports to ethnic Armenians living in the region,2
1,This in itself is telling,0
0,Russia issued passports to Abkhazians and South Ossetians just before its 2008 invasion of Georgia and also issued passports to Crimeans ahead of the annexation of Crimea last year,2
1,But Russia is only part of the problem,0
1,Many of the grievances Javakheti Armenians have are a result of poor policy making by the central government in Tbilisi,0
1,Many Javakheti Armenians feelthat their culture and language are discriminated against,0
1,There has been a decrease in the quality of education among the Javakheti Armenian population,0
1,"The bilingual education program ofteaching in both Georgian and Armenianhas been described as a ""total failure""",0
1,becausethere are not enough qualified teachers with proficiency in both languages,0
1,Unemployment is high in Samtskhe-Javakheti,0
1,future economic prospects in the region look bleak,0
1,Many Javakheti Armenians travel to Russia or Armenia for work,0
1,Thanks to the drop in the value of the Russian ruble - almost one-third of its value in the past year ,0
1,remittances have also decreased,0
1,The unusually harsh winter in the region is placing a further strain on economic activity,0
1,Then there is the issue of citizenship and immigration,0
0,Many Javakheti Armenians do not have Georgian citizenship,2
0, many hold Armenian passports,2
1,becausefinding seasonal work in Armenia and Russiais easier this way,0
1,"Until recently, Armenian citizens were allowedto live and work inside Georgia without any special authorisation",0
1,they crossed the border back into Armenia at least once a year,0
1,Last September this changed,0
0,Now Javakheti Armenians without Georgian citizenship can only stay in Georgia for three months at a time,2
1,Longer term residency permits are costly,0
1,These policies breed animosity and form a perfect stormthat could easily be exploited by Russia,0
1,It does not haveto be this way,0
1,Sensible policies can be pursued by Tbilisito address the legitimate grievances of the Javakheti Armenians,0
1,The West can makeit clear to Russiathat further meddling in Georgia's domestic affairs could lead to additional sanctions,0
1,The last thingthe South Caucasus needsis another sectarian conflict,0
1,"Whenpeople saythey have no politics,it meansthat their politics aligns with the status quo",0

1,"for which she appears, on one occasion,to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars",0
1,that she was bookedto speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing companythe bank had hiredto implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues,0

1,"Often unwittingly, they amplify the voices of the elite,whilemuffling thoseraised against it",0
0,A study by academics at the Cardiff School of Journalism examined the BBC Today programme's reporting of the bank bailouts in 2008,2
5,"It discoveredthat the contributorsit chosewere ""almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices",2
5,"Civil society voices or commentatorswho questioned the benefits ofhaving such a large finance sectorwere almost completely absent from coverage.""",2

1,The debate has been dominated by political and economic elites,0

1,Those priorities have changed your life,0
1,the BBC helpedto shape the political consensusunder which so many are now suffering,0
1,The BBC's business reporting breaks its editorial guidelines every day byfailingto provide alternative viewpoints,0
1,"Every weekday morning, the Today programme grovels to business leaders for 10 minutes",0
1,"It might occasionally challenge them on the value or viability of their companies, but hardly ever on their ethics",0

1,The current state of the US and UK governments' ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week-culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meetingto discuss the issue at the White House on Friday,0
1,Whenit comesto cybersecurity,0
1,it seemsthe UK and US wantto embrace every crazy idea exceptwhatwe know actually works,0
0,The UK's Cameron suggested earlier in the weekhe wantsto outlaw certain forms of encryption,2
1,which could potentially lead to some of the world's most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK,0
1,"That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, withvarious experts labelingit a nightmare for Internet security- on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China- and economically devastating for the British information technology industry",0
1,"Meanwhile, the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial lawthat was usedto prosecuteReddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz",0
1,passed,0
1,"the administration's proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity - for example,potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence forsharing your HBO GO password -all to supposedly target foreign hackersthat the law would likely never reach",0
5,"the Guardian published a secret report based onpreviously unreleased Snowden documents showingthat the US government is fully awarethat encryption is vital for security,andthat the government riskedleavingthemselves vulnerableifthey didn't startimplementing it on their own systemsquicker",2
1,The British government likely knows this too,0
0,many of their employees use email encryption,2
5,UK even recommendcitizens use encryptionto protect their data on a government website,2
1,"At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn't embrace Cameron's proposalwhenasked about it",0
1,even Cameron seemedto at least appearto back off his own anti-encryption proclamation,0
5,"sayinghe's ""not tryingto enunciate some new doctrine.""",2
1,just becauseCameron's been provento be technically illiterateand may be attemptingto publicly back away from his most radical proposal,0
1,that doesn't meanthat he won't later push forward,0
1,FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron's just a few months ago,0
1,Cameron used eerily similar talking points in Washington on FridayasComey did in late 2014,0
1,"Plus, the rest of Cameron's plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban",0
0,"And then there's the White House's so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem,which they unveiled earlier this week",2
0,"President Obama introducedit sayingwe hadto do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command's twitter account",2
1,whathe didn't saywasthat those proposals wouldn't have stopped those attacks at all,0
1,"Part of the Obama administration's proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statutethat the Justice Department usedto threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail",0
0,(Aaron later took his own life whileawaiting trial,2
1,"The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much sothat there's been a movement for yearsto reduce them",0
1,howthe administration thinksincreasing CFAA penalties is goingto worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (ormore likely pranksters)who take advantage of negligent password practicesis anyone's guess,0
1,"It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of peoplethe government shouldconsulting with",0
0," Congress has re-introduced their annual ""info-sharing"" cybersecurity bill",2
1,which is really just a thinly-veiled wayto siphon off more of Americans' private data without court oversight,0
5,"AsEFF put it,the bill ""offered new authoritiesthat could be abused by companiesto spy on users,and offered broad legal immunity fordisclosing the information obtained with the government",2
5,"Sometimes they even granted companies the abilityto 'hack back'...a perfect storm threatening our online privacy.""",2
1,"The President's alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much",0
1,"So, Congress and Obama seemto be finally on the same page about something: harsher penaltiesthat won't reach the hackersthey were worried aboutand invasive ""info-sharing""that doesn't come close tosolving existing problems",0
3,"God forbidthere be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship,orthat both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption",1

0,"On Monday, Nick Clegg pledgedto sign up the NHS to a national ""zero suicide"" campaign",2

0,"I have appeared on national radio, in the press and on televisionto talk about my story",2
0,"the more coverageI get,the more I ask:why me?",2
1,Letme makethis clear,0

1,I am not tryingto be famous,0
1,I am a normal lad,0

1,I am just another statistic,0
0,Someonewho suffered from an illnessthat took over my life and made mea personI didn't recognise,2
1,There is absolutely nothing special or unique about me,0
0,Yet I am getting calls from people askingme to share my story,2
1,"The factthat I am newsworthy,simply becauseI have spoken openly about the demonsI was facing,makesme thinkthat we are being greatly let down by society",0
4,Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged 20-49 in the UK,2
1,"It's a statisticthat, no matterhow many timesI say it,continuesto shock me to the core",0
1,"Yet it's somethingthat few people seemto be talking about openly,if at all",0
1,"I get it,we're British",0

1,Sometimes we'd rather not ask the questionbecausewe can't handle the answer,0
1,But that simply cannot continue,0
1,It's timethat people are madeto stand up and face the harsh reality,0
1,The fear ofbeing judgedis preventing people fromtalking about their secret turmoil,0
1,"There is very littlebeing done by the peoplewho havethe biggest influence to remove those fears, remove the stigmas,to get people talking about mental health,and makepeople comfortable with the subject",0

1,Do they help save enough lives?,0
1,The system needschanging from top to bottom,0
1,"There is no consistency or urgency, despite the high rate of men dying from suicide",0
1,What bigger wake-up calldo you need?,0
3,I would askDavid Cameron to speak up and tell uswhathe is goingto do,1
0,"To meet me,to letme introduce him to the small team at Calm,the volunteers, the campaigners, the people on the end of phones with someone's life in their hands",2
1,Letme show him peoplewho feelas ifthey have nowhereto turn,0
1,"Letme show him the lack of knowledge of some people working in GP surgeries, and the pressurethat thosewho make a positive differenceare working under,asrates of mental illness increase continually",0
1,Letme showhowso little can make such a big difference,0
1,IfNick Clegg is serious about mental health thenhe needsto show it,0
2,It's greatthat he has decidedthat we needto aim for zero suicides,2
1,"I wonder,whatwas the aim before this?",0
1,Just a few suicides?,0
1,A hundred?,0
1,Shouldn't the aim always have been zero?,0
1,"The likes of Calm, Mind, The Samaritans and everyone else, are doing incredible work",0
1,it shouldn't be left to themto do it all alone,0
2,They can only work with the limited resourcesthey have,2
1,They needsupporting and backing,0
1,We needto put faces and voices to genuine experiences,0
1,"Speaking out aboutdealing with depressionshouldn't be considered a ""brave"" act",0
1,it shouldn't be an extraordinary or unusual storyto read,0
1,It should be common,0
2,It should be accepted,2
1,It should be normal,0
1,"whilewe live in a societythat doesn't knowhowto deal with it,and perhaps does not wantto deal with it,we cannot expectpeople to talk openly about such private matters",0
1,Much focus is placed on thosewho are suffering,0
1,"in orderto truly help them,we needto makeeveryone else comfortable and knowledgeable enoughto knowwhatto do,howto act,and know howto signpost people to the helpthat is out there",0
1,We needto be talking about mental illness in schools,0
1,We needto make in-depth training compulsory in the workplace,0
1,"We needto be training taxi drivers, bar staff, hairdressers - peoplewho will find out more about a person through a casual conversationthantheir friends will ever know",0
1,"We needto normalisetalking about the realities of depression,to normalise conversations about the very real prospect of suicide",0
1,it is the only waywe can move forward together,0
1,We need a radical change from top to bottom,0
1,Therapy isn't just aboutlying on a couchwhilesomeone writes down your childhood memories,0

1,"There is someone missing in the now-famous picture of 40 heads of state and government leaders walking in the streets of Paris last Sunday, in an unprecedented show of solidarity with the French nation after last week's terrorist attacks",0
1,We all knowwho it is,0
1," frankly, most of us French people would have preferredto have President Obama or any other senior U.S  government official rather than Ahmed Davutoglu, the Turkish Prime Minister, or Victor Orban, his Hungarian counterpart, or Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister - those hypocriteswhose conception of ""freedom of expression""is not exactly that of Voltaire",0
1,"There is no good excuse for the U.S  physical absence (apart from the presence of Ambassador Jane Hartley,whose faceis unknown to 99.99% of the French population)from last Sunday's march",0
1,Perhaps the White House did not realizethat it would be a historical event?,0
1,"But for most world leaders, the decisionto be present in Pariswas a last minute decision",0
1,It would not not have been easy for the U.S  Secret Serviceto improvise the appropriate security measures?,0
1,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could do it,0
1,don't tell usthat Obama could not,0
1,"Perhaps the president did not wantto support the Charlie Hebdo peoplebecausehe believesthat ""the future must not belong to thosewho slander the prophet of Islam""(his words at the U.N  General Assembly in 2012)?",0
1,Not a good excuse ,0
1,"this was not aboutapprovingwhatthe French cartoonists were doing,but showing solidarity in the face of terrorism",0
1,Obama missed an opportunityto present himself as the leader of the free world in front of the continued menace of jihadi terrorism,0
1,that is his loss,0
1,The mere factthat his presence was apparently not even discussed in the the White Houseis a confirmationthat this administration does not feel as close to Europeasothers did in the past,0
1,we knew that already,0
1,"At the end of the day, I'm not surethat it really matters to us French in the current context",0
1,The debate after the march about Obama's absence became a debate in Franceonly becauseit was one in the United States,0
1,Some in the French government have whisperedthat Obama's presence would have relegated President Hollande to the shadows,0
1,"But most importantly, we received such an outpouring of sympathy from our American friends, Democrats and Republicans alike,that we knowthe United States could feel our pain",0
1,Justaswe felt America's pain after 9/11,0
1," there isabsolutely no doubt that US-French cooperation on counterterrorism,which was already excellent,will be tightenedeven more",0
0,"Immediately after the attacks, Washington offered support from its intelligence services",2
0,The White House has announcedthat it will convene a Summit on Counter-Extremism in February,2
1,that will be an opportunityto devise common strategies,0
1,Maybe the U.S  administration's biggest problem isthat we discovered its embarrassing absence only after the fact,0
1,Is President Obama tryingto sabotage Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run?,0
1,That's one take-away from his feisty State of the Union address,0
0,in which Mr  Obama did three things,2
1, he moved the Democratic agenda far to the left,0
1,whereHillary is not entirely comfortable,0
1," he rebuffed the clear preference of votersthat he work with Congress, bymakingthe cornerstone of his address proposals unacceptable to the GOP and third",0
1,he assured the countrythat our foreign policy (Hillary's foreign policy) is working,0
1,"Americans are not at all convinced,13 days afterthe vicious attacks on Charlie Hedbo in Paris,that Obama's ""broader strategy""is leading to ""a safer, more prosperous world.""",0
5,"Obama sayshe believes in a ""smarter kind of American leadership""",2
1,"for many in the country, the assertion borders on arrogance",0
1,None of these messages works for Hillary,0
1,Mr  Obama's focus on the middle class is unsurprising,0
1,"Lagging income growth for the average American has emerged as the likely debate in 2016, for good reason",0
1,"The numbers showthat during the Obama recovery, the middle class has,asJoe Biden put it,been ""left behind.""",0
1,The issue is valid,0
1,Mr  Obama's progressive approach tohelping average Americans- relying on more taxation and more government programs -- is not,0
0,DespiteAmericans listing job creation as their number one concern for the past six years,2
1,putting peopleto workhas never been President Obama's priority,0
1,He has not encouraged businessesto hire,0
1,"either throughreducing tax rates on employers or byexpanding business opportunities- through trade, or reduced regulations, for instance",0
1, his economic prescriptions have raised costs for employers through the onerous provisions of Obamacare and his effortsto raise the minimum wage,0
1,"As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down",0
1,many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companiesthat pay taxes as individuals,0
1,ashis proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring,0
1,"Such policies have led to labor participation ratesthat are still bumping along historical lows,a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages",0
1,A short course in economics might help the White House,0
1,a tighter jobs market will raise wages,0
1,The government raising wages will put people out of work,0
1,It's that simple,0
1,"Obama revisited his familiar theme ofmaking sureall Americans have a ""fair shot""",0
1,"he wantsto raisetaxes to make surethe rich do ""their fair share.""",0
1,He has never laid outwhatthat share should be,0
1,"he has tried hardto convince Americansthat the wealthy don't play ""by the same set of rules.""",0
1,It's a tired song,0
1,Americans have never bought the program,0
4,"A recent Rasmussen poll showedthat 60% of Americans thinkthe country is ""fair"" and ""decent.""",2
1,They don't believethat income distribution is the answer,0
1,"They believe in growth, in optimism, in everyone getting ahead",0
1,"The tax proposals outlined by President Obama are old school, and dead on arrival in the Republican Congress,ashe well knows",0
1,"Congress has indicated an eagernessto work with the president on tax reform,but has prioritizedchanging the dysfunctional corporate tax code",0
1,"The president understandsthat byplacing individual tax hikes first in the queue,he has just undermined any chance for bipartisan agreement",0
1,"And, byadopting the priorities of the left,which emphasize wealth redistribution and also embrace furtherexploiting the financial sectorhe is drafting behind liberal icon Senator Elizabeth Warren",0
1,"This is a slap at Hillary, for two reasons",0
1, Hillary is unquestionably uncomfortableputting on a progressive cloak,0
0,"In the fall campaigns she awkwardly mimicked Liz Warren's rhetoric,embarrassing herself with the head-scratcher ""Don't letanyone tell youthat it's businesses and corporationsthat create jobs.""",2
1,"Hillary is a successful, wealthy womanwho pretends otherwise and stubs her toe on money issues, such as",0
5,"whenshe described herselfandher husband as ""dead broke""uponleaving the White House",2
1, Hillary has difficulty distancing herself from Wall Street,0
5,the Wall Street Journal has reportedthat she and her husband have raised nearly $5 million from Goldman Sachs alone,2
1,It's also awkward for Mrs  Clintonthat the president has burned relations with Republicans,0
1,again,0
0,"In his speech,whiletalking about ""A better politics""in which ""we debate withoutdemonizing each other,""the president also threatenedto veto a number of GOP initiatives",2
1,"Voters have shownthey want the governmentto function -to repair our infrastructure, reform our dreadful tax code,to compete more effectively with our trading rivals,to streamline our outdated government agencies",0
1,For six years Mr  Obama has blamed the GOP forstanding in the way of his programs,0
1,now he will be the obstructer-in-chief,0
1,"From his State of the Union address, it is clearthat he is not interested inpartnering with Republicans",0
1,His aggressive executive actions over the past several weeks onpreventing deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and unilaterally overhauling our Cuba policywere the tip of the iceberg,0
1,Mr  Obama is not into compromise,0
1,"Voters do not like the president's""goit alone""program",0
1,they understandwhythe nation's founders included those pesky checks and balances,0
1,"Obama will makeit more difficult for any Democrattryingto succeedhim to convince votersthat he or she will ""work across the aisle"" - a claimthat Hillary might actually credibly make",0
1," Obama's insufficient resolve against the threat of Islamic terrorism, and convictionthat his efforts overseas are bearing fruit,are alarming",0
1,"Like Muggles fearful ofnaming the fearsome Voldemort,Obama seemsto thinkifhe just doesn't say ""Islamic terrorism"" out loud,the menace will pass him by",0
1,"His embarrassing absence in Paris, his waffle on Syria, his underestimation of ISIS-it all speaks to his pretensethat we have won the War on Terror",0
1,That our president can be so misled and so misleading on a matter of such grave importanceis horrifying,0
1,That Hillary Clinton was the enabler of his cluelessforeign policy is a serious problem for the former first lady,0
1," for the country, should shebe elected",0
1,"In his half century reign of terror, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro committed manifold atrocities",0
1,Documented evidence revealshim to be a ruthless tyrant,0
1,who endlessly abused the most basic of human rights,0
1,-a manwho played a pivotal role inbringing the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation for 13 harrowing days in October of 1962,0
1,"Beyondhis crimes against humanity and the callous sufferinghe inflicted on the people of Cuba,he ruined the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Americans",0
1,"He stole their land, homes, bank accounts, possessions and businesses",0
1,"He absconded with their property under the guise of ""nationalization.""",0
1,"But he is, in truth, a thief",0
1,Will his victims now be fairly compensated or otherwise see the return of their confiscated property in the wake of America's first steps toward rapprochement with Cuba?,0
1,The answer is both legal and political,0
2,President Obama holds the key,2
1,"So, don't get your hopes up",0
1,"In the first half of the 20th century, Americans and U.S  businesses dominated Cuba",0
1,They accumulated vast holdings of property and operated many of the most lucrative businesses,0
1,All of that ended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959,0
1,"Castro ""nationalized"" U.S.-owned industries and seized much of the island's private property from Americans",0
1,There was no restitution,0
5,One legal scholar calledit the largest uncompensated expropriation by a foreign government in history,2
0,"The U.S  retaliated with an embargo,prohibiting all trade",2
1,But the Americanswho were expelled from Cubawere left holding titles and deeds to homes and businesses towhich they had no access,0
1,Their property rights were dissolved,0
1,any legal judgments obtained were unenforceable against an isolated nationthat refusedto recognize any authority other than its own,0
0,Thousands pursued legal recourse and sought reparations under indemnification programs established by Congress,2
0,Others filed lawsuits and secured judgments,2
1,But Castro didn't care,0
1,"He repudiated the legitimacy of the restitution programs, the valuation of losses and the legal authority of the courts",0
1,"even thoughCuba admitstheir renegade nationalization was, and is,compensable",0
1, does Castroconsider fair compensation?,0
1,"Judging from his payouts to other aggrieved nations,it is mere pennies on the dollar",0
1,do you value dirt?,0
4,"In 1961, the U.S  Commerce Department valuedAmerican property seized by the Cuban government at roughly $ 1 to 1.8 billion",2
0,Nearly 6-thousand claims were legally certified,2
4,Other published reports placed the theft as high as $ 9 billion,2
1,"But the truth is,it's impossibleto know -especially inasmuchasthe value of everything plummeted the momentCastro took control of the island",0
1,Whatwould the same confiscated properties be worth in today's dollars?,0
1,$50 billion?,0
1,$100 billion?,0
1,How about nothing at all?,0
1,"Givenhowthe Castro brothers have driven their economy into the ground,making Cuba one of the poorest nations in the world",0
1,valuation could be closer to dirt than dollars,0
1,Which invites another question,0
1,"assuming a monetary valuecould somehow be devised,howwould Cuba pay for it?",0
1,"With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Castros lost their financial benefactor",0
1,The island is blighted and broke,0
1,it offered government bonds as compensation,0
1,",are they worth the paper uponwhich they are written?",0
1,Howcould they be secured?,0
1,Reclaim the property?,0
2,"Theoretically, it is possible for the confiscated propertyto be reclaimed someday by the original owners",2
1,But that would require a dramatic Cuban transformation from socialism to democracywhereprivate property ownership is permitted,0
0,"In a recent speech, Cuban President Raul Castro insistedCuba would not renounces its core socialist ideals as part of the dealhe negotiated with President Obamato renew diplomatic relations",2
1,some semblance of democracy wereto be restored to Cuba in the distant future,0
1,whatremains of the stolen property?,0
1,No one knowshowmany of the private residencesthat were seizedhave been divided or fallen into decay,0
2,Some may no longer exist,2
1,And what of the current occupants?,0
1,Would they allowthemselves to be kicked out?,0
1,"The same may be true of the many farms, industries and commercial businessesthat were confiscatedand have been put to other uses in the last 5 decades",0
1,"Yes, they have development potential in an open, free market society",0
1," again, the future of Cuba is nebulous",0
1,How realisticis the return of these vast holdings under a continuing Castro regime?,0
1,What Obama should do,0
1,"As a first condition to normalizing relations, President Obama should demandthat all American victims of stolen property be compensatedequitably",0
1,He is already obligated by lawto do this under the Helms-Burton Act,0
1,But Obama has a propensityto ignore or overrule with impunity those lawshe regards as misguided or inconvenient,0
1,This is one lawhe should follow,0
1,A second condition should be the establishment of a commission of judges with legally binding authority to render compensation decisions,0
1,"Several reparation models can be studied and replicated, notably the tribunalthat dispensed claims in post-unification Germany",0
1,President Obama has the power and leverageto forcethe Castro regime to capitulateifCuba wantsto end the sanctions and restore economic relations,0
1,"But so far, he has uttered not a word about a desireto do so",0
1,"whenit comes to negotiations with adversaries,Obama tendsto give away the store",0
2,Nobody can be surewho will govern us after May,2
1,That uncertainty is the great gift of a democracy,0
1,"whata gap between the ideal of citizens interrogating leaders,to decidewhetherpower should change hands,and the arid long campaign this lookssetto become",0
1,"In response to their difficulty incapturing anybody's attention,the party strategists have decidedthat the leaders should mostly tryto say much the same thing every day for the next four months",0
1,British Future's state of the nation poll illuminateswhythat approach might seemto make sensebut alsowhyit won't be enough,0
1,"Half the electorate knowswho they are voting forandwhatthey thinkthe ""big issue"" is for the election - with the committed voters of each party differing onwhetherit is the NHS, the economy or immigrationthat matters most",0
1,The contrast between the certainties of these partisan tribes and the uncertainties of the broader electorate will set the tone of the election year,0
1,"It's not just Conservative and Labour voters,butUkippers toowho think their partywill be in government - orthat Nigel Farage might be prime minister in May",0
1,"Across the spectrum, those with the strongest views overestimatehow many peopleshare them",0
1, the public gives a thumbs-down verdict to every partywhenaskedifthey would like them in power,0
1,"More worryingly, only a quarter of people are confidentthat Britain will come through the election withoutthe tone of the debate damaging relations between different groups in Britain today",0
1,Uncertainty about the democratic outcome is a good thing,0
1,uncertainty aboutwhetherBritain can handle the election-year debatesis not,0
1,"Both the Conservatives, inomitting immigration from their six priority themes,and Labour inadvising canvassersto move the conversation on,have ironically shownthat it is possibleto get headlines bynot talking about immigration",0
1,Running scared from the issue simplymisunderstands public opinion,0
1,Most people want a politicsthat engages with the pressures brought by immigrationand yet secures the benefits too,0
1,So our appeal for an open and responsible debate can be made not just to the social conscience of politicians but to their enlightened self-interest too,0
1,The new state of the nation findings offer an important reasonwhywe might find more confidence in Britain's abilityto handle the immigration and identity debates,0
1,"In a polarised ""culture war"" - between thosewho don't understandwhyeverywhere is not like Londonand thosewho dislike everythingthat has changed since the 1950s- there will be no winners, only losers,whetherthe argument is about immigration, identity or Islam or, indeed, gender and gay rights",0
1, there will be some votes in appeals to either pole of the political spectrum,0
1,but no majority victory nor stable governing coalition could be won on the basis of a political offerthat failsto appeal beyond a party's core support,0
1,Voters expect our politiciansto articulate our disagreements,0
2,We knowthey needto make suretheir own supporters do go out and vote,2
1,But leadership is also abouthelpingus to find the common ground,0
1,"Which of themcould yet find the voiceto engage beyond their own political tribe,to come off the ""grid"" and do more than put out the linethat the script demands?",0
1,"In an uncertain and fractious society, there is a greater appetite for politicians with the confidenceto speak to people of different generations, to engage in both the cities and out on the coast, and to reach across class, geography and ethnicity",0
1,Will anyone step upto meet that challenge in the next three months?,0
1,"If not,that could still be the voicethat much of Britain is waitingto hear",0
3,Sunder Katwala is the director of British Future,1
1,President Obama sure is consistent,0
1,His State of the Union address sounded like his other speeches,0
1,WhatI've doneis great!,0
1,America is in a much better position,0
0,We've created a manufacturing sectorthat's adding jobs,2
0,More oil is produced at home,2

1,The deficit is lower now not because of any prudence on Obama's part butmerely becausethe $800 billion stimulus spending blowout didn't continue,0
1,All the president doesis increase spending,0
1,"freecommunity college, free Obamaphones, free birth control, etc",0
4,"Yes, our annual deficit is lower",2
4,it's still $488 billion!,2
4,Our $18 trillion national debt increases by $3 million every minute!,2
4,"Yes, more oil is produced at home",2
1,that's in spite of the administration,0
4,Oil production is down on public land,2
4,"Yes, the manufacturing sector added jobs",2
1,that's mostly because of cheaper natural gas created by fracking,0
1,which Obama's cronies opposed,0
1, America is finally recovering from recession,0
1,Obama's policies probably slowed that recovery,0
1,"Does the President delude himselfwhenhe takes credit for oil production, lower deficits, etc.?",0
1,Or does he mislead on purpose?,0
3,I don't know,1
5,"More recentlyhe bragged,""I created the lowest unemployment rate in years.""",2
1,He created it?,0
1,"He must knowit's ""low"" only compared to the 10 percent reached during the recession ",0
1,becausemillions have simply given uplooking for work,0
1,This recovery is the slowest in 70 years,0
1,Obama gave the State of the Union addressI'd liketo hear,0
1,he'd say this,0
1,"I heard you, voters, in Novemberwhenyou took control of the Senate away from my party",0
1,I get it,0
1,I overreached,0
1,I was arrogant,0
1,I imposed Obamacare on a nationthat was deeply divided about it,0
1,I ruled through executive orders instead of legislation,0
1,"I threw money at ""green"" nonsense",0
1,"I'll give up the payments to the ""green energy"" industryifthe Republicans stop coddling defense contractors",0
0,I've been in government for years now,2
1,I knowhow badlyit works,0
1,The last thingI should tryto dois makeit bigger,0
1," with Republicans now in control of Congress, it's timeI worked with themto shrink government",0
1,we shrink itwe might even dig our way out of the debt holewe're in,0
1,we just slow the growth of government to 2 percent a year,0
1,we'd be in better shape,0
1,But I didn't even tryto accomplish that,0
1,I pretendedtaxing the richwould solve our financial problems,0
1,But there aren't enough rich people to tax,0
1,"I got drunk on the idea of promising voters ""free"" stuff such as low down- payment mortgages and guaranteed paid family leave",0
1,I told themthat all good things come from government,0
1,That's nonsense,0
1,We should put an end to all bailouts,0
1,"Businesses that screw up should accept the consequences, just like ordinary peoplewho spend recklessly",0
1,Main Street should never again be forcedto rescue Wall Street,0
1,"Instead ofexpanding government control of health care,we should phase it out",0
1,That includes Medicare,0
1,I knowMedicare is popular,0
1,it is unsustainable,0
1,Letcurrent retirees receive their benefits aspromised,0
1,younger people should pay for their own health care,0
1,People criticize the economic distortion created by welfare,0
1,Medicare and Social Security are almost as bad,0
1,Both redistribute money away from the young and struggling toward those of uswho have had decadesto investand save up,0
1,"To makethese challenges a little easierto deal with,let's makeAmerica richer byabolishing most regulations",0
1,They strangle opportunity,0
1,"The moreI think about it,the more Congress and I could transform America for the better just bygetting out of America's way",0
1,The state of our union will be truly strongifthe state -- bywhich I mean government-- is strictly limited,0
0,"John Stossel is the host of ""Stossel"" (Thursdays at 9 PM/ET), a weekly program highlighting current consumer issues with a libertarian viewpoint",2

1,Here's a prediction: expect a narrativeto emerge in certain media outlets in the coming daysthat Tuesday night's State of the Union speech was a grand returnto form for President Obama,0
1,"The elite, east-coast intelligencia line will bethat the beleaguered lame duck president--facing a hostile, conservative Congress--regained his momentum with renewed energy and purpose",0
1,HowObama Got His Groove Back,0
1,the fact remainsthat Obama's next-to-last State of the Union address did not substantially address two of the most pressing issues currently facing our nation and that matter most to its military veterans: the lack of a clear United States national security strategy--to include the crisis facing our military--and the inability of the VA bureaucracy careto deliver timely health care to millions of our veterans,0
1,But you wouldn't know it bylistening to Tuesday night's State of the Union address,0
1,President Obama is living in a fantasy world,0
5,"The president saysthat we're ""stopping ISIL's advance.""",2
1,"in reality, his campaign of airstrikes have not been successful",0
1,ISIS controls more territory in Iraq and Syria today than ever before,0
5,"He also boldly claimedthat ""we're slashing the backlogthat had too many veteranswaiting yearsto get the benefitsthey need,""",2
1,this statement too just doesn't match up with reality,0
4,"Today, nearly 250,000 veterans are still stuck in the VA claims backlog and another 290,000 languish in the appeals process",2
1,"Is that still ""too many,"" Mr  President?",0
1,Unfortunate events will likely force the president's attention to these issues in 2015,0
1,ISIS didinIraq and Phoenix did for the VA in 2014,0
1, President Obama could be proactive and get ahead of these issues bypursuing the following four agenda items,0
1,Articulate a real national security strategy,0
1,"The president's plan for""leading from behind""--and thatnational security and foreign policy boils down to ""don't do stupid stuff""--is no substitute for a real strategy,asdeteriorating situations in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere prove",0
1,"Likewise, denying the nature of the enemywe face(""ISIS is not Islamic"")only muddies the water further",0
1,emboldening our enemies and confusing our allies,0
0,President Obama also toutedending the 14 year-long war in Afghanistan,2
1,"""ending""is different than""winning.""",0
1,His telegraphed withdrawals have pulled us out of conflictsbeforethey're resolved,0
1,creating power vacuums in Iraq- and soon in Afghanistan-that leaveAmerica more vulnerable,0
0,"And incredibly, for the first time since 9/11, the president failedto even mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda ",2
1,"both of which are far from ""on the run""ashe proclaimed in 2012 and are advancing and actively challenging the West",0
1,Get serious aboutfixing defense spending,0
1,"Instead ofcutting fat,the president's ill-conceived defense budget sequester has slashed into the muscle of our military force",0
1,"The administration should striveto replace defense sequestration, byimplementing serious and commensurate acquisitions and compensation reforms",0
1,"Reforming these areas will reduce Pentagon budgetary pressures caused by massive weapons system cost-overruns and exploding personnel costs, allowing for a more strategic allocation of war-fighting resources",0
1,"In orderto live within a fiscally responsible reality, and most importantly maintain the world's most capable military,the administration and Congress must get serious about real DoD spending reform",0
0,His address last night didn't even mention sequestration,2
1,Develop and implement a planto tackle the national debt,0
1,"Respected military leaders like Marine General James Mattis, Admiral Mike Mullen, and many others recognizethat the biggest long-term threat to our national security is our massive national debt",0
1,"At more than $18 trillion and growing, the debt is on trackto double under President Obama",0
1,"It is absolutely vital to the fiscal, economic, and military strength of our countrythat we have a serious planto get our debt under control through reductions in spending and significant reforms across the government",0
1,Implement more accountability and choice at the VA,0
1,"The VA reforms passed by Congress last yearwere a good first step, but will not address the deeper, systemic culture problems at VA",0
1,"In the next Congress, the president should champion even deeper reforms at VAto bring accountability for poor performing employees throughout the department and to expand health care options for veterans outside the VA system",0
1,"These basic principles would not only address a campaign promisethe president has failedto deliver on(""fixing the VA"")but would showthat he is finally serious aboutimproving veterans' access to the quality health carethey earned",0
1,"Whatthe president misses, and even defies,in his latest list of proposals isthat Americans don't think governmentisn't doing enough",0
1,"They thinkgovernment does too much,that most of whatit does,it does poorly",0
1,that it doesn't attend to the issuesthat matter to them,0
1,Focusing on the four agenda itemsabove would send a messagethat the president is finally serious aboutgoverning in his last two years in office,0
1,It's probably too muchto ask for Obamato change his approach at this stage in his presidency,0
1,"it's essentialifhe wantsto avoid a legacy of division, defiance and neglect",0
1,the president continues on his current course?,0
1,"Well, the items listed above will become part of a compelling agenda for his potential successors",0
1,they take to the campaign trail for 2016,0
