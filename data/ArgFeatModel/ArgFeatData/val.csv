1,"In lieu of a strong self-concept, the young build themselves out of a mosaic of allegiances",0
1,The online world is fertile ground for these,0
0,"Tumblr, Twitter and 4chan, for example, are full of young people pledging fervent allegiance to a favorite fan culture, a political movement or a self-diagnosis, with all the rights, privileges, and rivalriesthat implies",2
1,Some of these will be important parts of a person's identity for life,0
1,Others will mortify them within a year,0
1,"At that age, it can be very, very hardto tellwhich will be which",0
1,"Building a self-conceptmeansstaking your claim for an audience, however small",0
1,I'm surekids still write private stuff,0

1,there had been Tumblr back then,0
1,I would have been on it like scarves on Sherlock,0
1,The support of the invisible masses can be incredibly positive,0
1,"For teenswho are isolated physically or emotionally,the internet might provide the first glimmer ofunderstandingthat there's nothing actually wrong with them",0
1,"It can be a wayto connect with other people,to build support systems towhich you don't have access in your offline life, a wayto live and explore an identitythat you might haveto keep hidden or secret for your own protection",0
1,But there can also be pitfalls,0
1,"Sometimes,whenyou're tryingto figure outwho you areandwhatyou believe,you test out a lot of convictions",0
0,"(I had an""I hate feministsbecausethey get madwhenmen hold doors for them""phase, for example",2

1,The danger ofovercommitting topassing thoughts bymakingthem publicisn't just a pitfall for teens,0
1,Adults do it all the time ,0
1,"they make an offhanded comment and then makeit worsewith a defensive non-apology, or complain about an offhanded comment and set off the outrage machine",0
1,"But the teen years are an identities factory,churning out new products right and left",0

1,you're much more susceptibleto peer pressure,0
1,It's perfect lab conditions forgetting locked into an idea of yourselfthat would have otherwise been ephemeral,0
1,I'm not sayingwe should keep teenagers off the internet,0

1,Whatstops a man frombeating up and raping his female partner?,0
4,"According to research published today, it is not sanctions imposed by the criminal justice system, such as prison or probation, but attending a course with other abusers",2
0,"""Domestic violence perpetrator programmes (DVPPs): steps towards change"",by the feminist academics Liz Kelly and Nicole Westmarland, is based on interviews with menwho attend programmesthat aimto re-educate them about their behaviourto improve the safety of women and children",2
5,"The research -which also draws on the experiences of partners of the violent men, a small number of children and the staff of these programmes- findsthat ""the vast majority of menwho abusetheir partners stop their physical and sexual violenceifthey attend a DVPP"" and that such programmes""could play an important role in the questto end domestic violence""",2
1,Some of the figures look impressive,0
4,beforeattending the programmea third of men asked womento perform sexual acts against their wishes,2
4,none did so aftertaking part,2
4,Cases of the men using a weapon against their partner reduced from 29% to nil,2
1,But there are other findingsthat giveme cause for concern,0
4,"Ninety per cent of the men interviewed had, prior to the course, made excuses about and attemptedto justify their abusive behaviour",2
4,"After the course, this tendency had barely reduced at all, withalmost three-quarters of the men still making excuses",2
0,whenmaking plain my scepticism about DVPPsI have been toldthat the aim of such courses isto makeperpetrators accountableand getthem to face up towhatthey have done,2
1,This finding showsthat this is one of the weakest outcomes,0
1,What about prevention of domestic violence?,0
1,Does the existence of these courses deter others fromusing their fiststo settle an argument?,0
4,"On average, two women in England and Wales die each week as a result of domestic violence, a figurethat has remained constant for decades",2
1,"I can't imagine a government-led information campaign with the slogan,""Violent men beware!Beat up your wife and go on a course""",0
4,"Over half of the women reportedfeeling ""very safe"" after the programme, compared with less than one in 10 before it",2
4,But that leaves almost half of the women still in fear,2
1,One major tactic used by violent men isto control the household finances,0
1,so that the woman is totally reliant on him and has no means of escape,0
4,"The research foundthat after DVPP, this behaviour changed ""only marginally""",2
1,There is also some evidencethat DVPPs do not necessarily encouragewomen to leave violent men,0
0,The researchers used a control group of womenwho were accessing support for domestic violence,2
0,whose partnerwas not attending a DVPP,2
4,"The control group also reported a significant reduction in violence from the men, but were more likelyto end the relationship with the abuser than the women",2
4,whose partners were attending a DVPP,2
1,Perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together?,0
1,Is this not dangerous?,0
1,"The impression given by the widespread acceptability of these programmes isthat thosewho beat and rape their partnersare in need of support and help, not punishment",0
1,There are moves by the Home Officeto roll out restorative justice measures in cases of sexual and domestic violence,0
0,"a recent government inquiry intostalking legislationposed the question ofwhether""treatment programmes should be available for perpetratorsand,ifso,what should be their content?""",2
5,"According to Nicole Westmarland, one of the report authors,""we have hardly any knowledge abouthowthings like probation, fines, or even prison affect men's attitudes and behaviours towards women""",2
1,"This is true, but mainlyso few perpetrators are heldto account by the courts",0
1,We appearto have given up the battleto have domestic violence treated as a crime like any other -which usedto be the feminist mantra- and have now declared the criminal justice system unfit for purpose indealing with violence in the home,0
1,We should not be giving up on the justice systembeforeits potential effectiveness has been truly tested,0
1,There are many waysits approach to domestic violence could be improved,0
1,"Pilot programmes should be rolled out nationwide,directing policeto mandatorily arrest thosewho have committed acts of violence towards partners or ex-partners",0
1,perpetrators will realisethat it is not the decision of their victimsto send them to court,0
1,victims will be in no further danger of revenge fordoing so,0
1,The Crown Prosecution Service needsto take a more robust approach ingetting perpetrators to courtand speed up the processsothe victim does not haveto wait months for an outcome,0
1,"During this process, the victims involved should be protected and supported by state-funded initiatives",0
1,"Public education campaignsthat aimto tug on the heartstrings of abusers, such as posters depicting womencrying and sporting injuries,should be swapped for images of men in handcuffs or in a prison cell",0
1,Young women and men needto be educated aboutwhatis at the root of domestic and sexual violence,0
1,-that it is a cause and consequence of inequality and sexism,0
1,Peoplewho beat their partnersare making a choice,0
1,"We needto make sure the messagethat this isa serious crime, not an illness, is disseminated in schools",0
1,"Letus return to the notion, once at the heart of the feminist challenge to domestic violence,that beating up your partnershould carry as serious a consequence asassaulting a member of the public in the street",0
1,Twelve people were massacred in Paris on Wednesday merely forexpressing their opinion through art,0
1,Many might not like the artthat prompted the carnage,0
1,They may considerit obscene and even an attack on their faith,0
1,"But in the 21st, 15th or 57th century -whateveryour religion, calendar, or country- there is no excuse or justification forresponding to art with murder",0
1,"But there is a clear and frightening explanation for this violence, onethat demands not merely outrage at the act itself, but at the systemthat has madeitboth predictable and inevitable",0
1,"The problem isthat this system is hundreds of years old, implicates most everyone, and has only becomemore entrenched in the last several decades",0
1,asthe world has becomeever more globalised,0
3,Wheredoes the story begin?,1
1,It's no mere coincidencethat at least two of the Charlie Hebdo attackers are reportedly of Algerian descent and the third from Senegal,0
1,"France's 1830 invasion of Algeria began a 130-year odyssey of murder, expropriation, racism, exploitation and misrulethat only ended after a vicious anti-colonial struggle costing well over one million Algerian lives",0
5,"""Colonisationbrought the genocide of our identity, of our history, of our language, of our traditions""ishowPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika well describedit",2
1,"French rule in sub-Saharan West Africa was even more costly, particularly in the context of the centuries-long slave trade",0
1," as insomany newly independent countries, post-independence Algeria and Senegal were ruled by a governmentthat was tied umbilically to the former coloniser",0
1,"which,however ""postcolonial"" their official ideology and credentials,becameincreasing authoritarian and corrupt",0
1,"In Algeria, the petroleum-rich FLN state - known as ""the pouvoir"" because of its all-pervasive power - went so far asto launch a brutal internal warthat claimed 100,000 lives in the 1990s with the direct support of the West,all to preserve its absolute grip on power",0
1,"Nigeria, another major oil producer, received similar support for its even more ruinous war against Biafra in the late 1960s",0
1,"The devastationit caused,including at least one million dead, is one of the rarely discussed causes of the Boko Haram phenomenon",0
1,The experiences of Algeria and Senegal are in no way unique,0
1,They comprise the story of the modern Muslim world,0
1,"where with the exception of Turkey, Iran and part of the Arabian peninsula mostevery society from Morocco to Indonesia fell under generations of European rule in the 19th and 20th centuries",0
1,"The collective wound of colonialism, its distortion and often destruction of existing pathways to modernity, is for all practical purposes immeasurable",0
1,"As with a bodythe deep wounds of foreign domination and postcolonial dictatorship can take a lifetimeto heal properly,if ever",0
1," the chances of healing - of some level of local, democratically accountable control of political and economic development - have become even more remote in the era of neoliberal globalisation",0
1,which has been rightly seen by many across the region as essentially colonialism dressed in new clothes,0
1,"(IMF and World Bank policies strongly resemble those of the international banksthat brought Tunisia, Egypt and the Ottoman Empire to bankruptcy, and ultimately foreign control, between 1863 and 1875)",0
1,Radical Islam has today charted a paththat mirrors radical capitalism,0
1,"usingviolence only shocks ""us""",0
1,becausewe've managedto make the violence unleashed and supported for so long in our name morally and politically invisible,0
1,The major world powers have long coddled favoured local despots of whatever ideological stripe,0
1,"But the strength of the relationships between western governments and the petroleum-rich states of the Arab world, secured by trillions of dollarscycling back and forth between them through oil and arms sales, finance and heavy industry,is historically unprecedented",0
1,"Both are rapidly anti-democratic,support the concentration of wealth and power, and draw much of their strength from violence, war and a manageable level of chaosthat keepoil prices high and petrodollarsrecycled via everything from fancy weapons to even fancier real estate",0
1,Add to that the ongoing and well-documented structural racism against France's large Arab/Muslim and African communities,0
1,"which has included mass murder in the streets of Parisand remains ""rampant"" not merely in the poor suburbs of major cities",0
1,"whereconcentrated poverty and marginalisation lead so many to crime, drugs,prison and, not uncommonly, to radicalisation",0
1,"Whennewspapers such as the left-leaning Liberation declarethat ""Europe's leaders are in shock"" over the latest attack,their naivety is hardto forgive",0
1,Shocking?,0
1,"It's no more shockingthat some Muslims have becomepsychotic enough to murder, rape and pillage their way across eastern Nigeria and eastern Paristhanit isthat France, home of ""liberty"", ""equality"", and ""fraternity"", sells billions of dollars of weapons and otherwise provides political and diplomatic support to countriesthat practice the polar opposite of all three",0
1,that the US kills thousands of civilians with drones (and tens of thousands with conventional weapons)that are as merciless as the terroriststhey presumably target,0
1,"that Israel kills 1,500 Palestinians with the complete acquiescence of the US and Europe",0
1,"that most every Muslim government condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo routinely imprisons and tortures artists and activists for far less offensive expression, all with the support of the West",0
5,"As the Lebanese cartoonist Karl Sharro (aka Karl reMarks) points out,ultimatelythe violence against Charlie Hebdo is not about Islam per se",2
5,it's about a contemporary world systemthat is particularly adept atgrinding downwhateverdecent values exist in Islam and other faith systems (andin liberal capitalism as well),2
1,Decades of the combined onslaught of extreme capitalism and extreme religion have shaped a necropolitics of the oppressed,0
1,"that is the mirror image of the necropolitics of local and western governments,and the oppression and violencethey've imposed",0
5,"Former Charlie Hebdo editor Philippe Val,who lost most of his close friends on Wednesday,lamentedthat ""our country will never be the same"", and called on France's Muslim communityto ""be with us""asthey confront the scourge of nihilistic terror",2
1,to whatFrance can Muslims truly belong?,0
3,"which Islam can empower them towards a modernitythat provides at least a modicum of ""bread, dignity and social justice"" ",1
1,Charlie Hebdo reminds us of anythingit isthat the arc of blowback can stretch for decades,0
1,",growing more uncontrollable as the political, economic, social and technological chaos of the contemporary world increases",0
1,"In the coming weeks, Americans will embark on the painful process offiling their tax returns",0
1,"this annual ritual leaves most people confused, depressed and overwhelmed",0
1,many will be faced with the additional step this year ofpaying hundreds or thousands of dollarsifthey chosenot to purchase health insurance under ObamaCare for 2014,0
0,"Under the individual mandate required by the president's new health care law, Americans for the first time must pay the higher of two penaltiesifthey are uninsured and did not enroll in ObamaCare last year--either $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, or 1 percent of their yearly household income above the $10,000 tax filing threshold",2
0,"That meansan individual earning $50,000 will face a penalty of $400 this year",2
0,"fines could reach up to $2,448 per person or up to $12,240 for a family of five",2
1,"Unfortunately, these penalty rates will only continueto climb",0
0,"Next year, penalties will more than double for thosewho do not enroll in ObamaCare in 2015",2
0,"costing the same individual earning $50,000 per year a whopping $800, and families up to tens of thousands of dollars",2
1,No American should be forced into the president's one-size-fits-all health care mandate,0
1,Health care should be based on the fundamental principle of freedom,0
1,Americans should be ableto have the abilityto make their own health care decisions without fearthat the government will extract onerous penalties from them,0
1,"That iswhywe reintroduced The ObamaCare Opt-Out Act of 2014 in the Senate last week, important legislationthat will allow Americans to opt-out of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage required by ObamaCare",0
1,"This bill would allowindividuals to either notify their state or the federal health care exchange, or use their tax filing to opt-out of ObamaCare and avoid the penalty",0
5,"According to the tax-services provider H&R; Block, this would impact about 4 million uninsured Americans in 2015",2
1,"After four years of ObamaCare, hardworking Americans continueto see their health care costs risewhiletheir coverage choices diminish",0
1,It is far past time for American familiesto once again have the freedomto make their own decisions aboutwhatis best for their families,0
1,"Asthe 114th Congress gets underway,we will continueto makethis bill a priorityand workto restore Americans' freedomto buy affordable health insurancethat works for them",0
1,"they knowwhat'sbest for their families, not the Obama administration",0
0,I'm not surewhenthe abnormal became normal,2
1,I remember a time not so long agowhena marathon runner was a mythical beast,0
1,we all knew someonewho knew someonewho had run a marathon,0
1,"most of us had only ever seen these creatures on the TV in their emaciated, long-limbed flow",0
1,now everyone knows a marathon runner,0
1,they just look like normal people,0
1,"Somewhere along the way,marathons became commonplace",0
1,a whole new breed of extreme activities came along-the Ironman triathlon; multi-day cycle events like John O'Groats to Lands End; crazy ultra marathons like the Thames Path 100; and eventsthat defy description like the Tough Mudder.,0
1,a lot of extreme challenges areto do with ultra endurance,0
1,the Tough Mudder is short but involvesgetting hurt.Sometimes by electric shocks.And fire,0
1,"Whatis wrong with you, Mudders?",0
1,I have no ideawhatcaused the rise of the extreme sports as a phenomenon,0
0,I do knowwhathappened for me,2
0,"After many years of corporate life and general indolence I foundmyself resting a glass of champagne on a large belly, unableto get to the buffet without puffing",2
0,"Horrified at the realisationthat I had become Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life,I resolved immediatelyto sign up for the Great Edinburgh Run",2
0,The GER was only 10k,2
0,it terrified me and filled me with doubts,2
0,whatifI came last?,2
0,Do I haveto run all the way?,2
0,Will I be the fattest dude on the course?,2
0,Four months later I completed it easily,2
0,And then I signed up for a marathon,2
0,And then an Ironman,2
1,And this is the thing - every step of the wayyou reassess your judgment ofwhatis crazy,0
1,It becomes a rapidly escalating obsession,0
1,Whatseemed like a hardcore event reserved solely for proper endurance loonssoon becomes just within reach,0
1,"Six years after the GER, the only eventI still considerto be bonkers beyond beliefis the Marathon des Sables",0
1,And that'sonly becauseeveryone knowsthat Scots melt in the desert,0
1,My personal theory for the rise of the extreme sports isthat life has becomesterile,0
1,The chances ofreally getting an adrenaline rush in day-to-day lifeis minimal,0
1,people search out waysto re-engage with life,0
0,"Aftercompleting two Ironman events,I can testifythat the feeling ofsweeping down the finish chute after 140.6 miles topumping pop music,flashing lights and a cheering crowdis the ultimate buzz",2
0,"finishing a marathon, in an empty car park, in the dark, in the pouring rain,is easily its equal for an overwhelming inner sense of achievement",2
0,The other personal joyI get from training for eventsis the quiet time,2
1,Althoughmodern life is humdrum,0
1,it is noisy,0
0,"even a three-mile run gives me the chanceto clear my head, breathe cold fresh air and feel the wind on my skin",2
0,Within 10 minutes ofbeginning a runmy head is clear,2
0,I am calm,2
0,I am reset,2
1,The side benefit of all this training (and probably the reasonthat most people start) is health,0
1,"Ifyou run, cycle or swim youlose weight and feel more vital for it",0
1,"You are fitter, stronger and sleep more soundly",0
1,"You are fit for life - the kid climbing on your shoulders, the run for the bus",0
1,evenjust climbingthe stairs become infinitely more manageable,0
1,It also sets a great example,0
0,my three-year-old has now collected finisher's medals at Ironkids and Loch Ness Marathon and lovesbeing outside,2
0,becausethat'swhatmummy and daddy do,2
1,The increase in demand cannot be satisfied,0
1,A new event seemsto spring up every day,0
1,"No longer restricted by a single Ironman distanceyou can do double, triple or even (for the proper enthusiasts) deca Ironman",0
1,"You can run the 268 frostbitten, British-winter miles of the Spine Race",0
1,You can even get teargassed in the Tough Mudder,0
1,"Whetherfor the T-shirt, the tattoo or just the sheer pride of accomplishment,extreme sports are hereto stay",0
1,"Here in California,it's been a blockbuster week in politics",0
0,Barbara Boxer is finally stepping down as perma-Senator after over 20 years,2
0,former San Francisco mayor and current lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom is running for governor,2
0,attorney general Kamala Harris gunning for Boxer's soon-to-be- vacated seat,2
1,Whydoes it matter?,0
1,There's certainly something compelling about Harris' daring bid for US Senate,0
0,there are only one in five senators are female in this Congress,2
0,there are only two black Senators currently (Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tim Scott from South Carolina),2
1,Harris won,0
1,"she not only would contribute to the growing number of women in power,buthaving three actual black senators at one timewould make history",0
1,"because,to date, two is the bestwe've been ableto achieve as a nation",0
0,"In America's entire history,only eight black people have ever been senators",2
4,"of those, only half were actually elected, rather than appointed",2
4,"Yet African-Americans make up about 13% of the population, according to the 2013 census",2
1,True proportional representation would see black senators in the double digits in Congress,0
1,California has outsized importance in the US economy,0
4,"on its own, it is the world's eighth-largest economy, just behind booming Brazil but ahead of Russia and Italy",2
1,California's contributions are one of the chief reasonsthe US remains the world's biggest economy,0
1,a black woman is poisedto be one of the most nationally influential politicians in the state,0
1,"California's internal public policy tussles - and its standard more-liberal- than-the-nation solutions - often help lead the rest of the nation and the world forward, be it on pollution standards, minimum wage increases, medical marijuana legalization, organic produce certification, healthcare access for the uninsured, public-private technology innovation such as iHubs and tax breaksthat encourage local production of zero-emission Teslas,same sex marriage and wetlands protections such as the CA Coastal Act of 1976",0
1,"California's politicians can bring to Washington the abilityto combine strong, safe regulatory experience with a booming economy and environmental protections,offering a compelling counter-point to Republicanswho argue otherwise",0
1," with the exception of Jerry Brown's first stint as governor from 1975-1983, California internal top politics has been tendedto be dominated by southern California figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger",0
1,Harris (and Newsom) are both northern California people through and through,0
1,"Instead of Hollywood values and priorities holding sway in the state, northern California's tech-powered financial and cultural strength may finally have a chanceto drive the state's politics",0
1,"whileBoxer, her fellow senator Dianne Feinstein and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi all hail from northern California,they spend much of their time in Washington DC ",0
1,Harris's move to DC will provide us with a new generation of representatives steeped in the area's emerging tech-focused culture,0
1,WhileI believeCalifornia has muchto gain from politicians like Newsom and Harris,0
1,who see their work as largely cooperative and people-focused- as opposed to the ideological culture warriorswho normally represent us in national policy debates,0
1,- there's a long road ahead for each,0
1,"Harris, for instance, may haveto contend with billionaire Tom Steyer and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in a Democratic primary (andVillaraigosa would make history of his own)",0
1,But Harris is likelyto have a lot of supportbehind her and ,0
1,"being young,at 50 -a run now forSenate still leavesthe door opento run for governor 10 or 20 years down the road",0
1, stranger things have happened in CA politics,0
0,who would have thoughtthat B-list actor Ronald Reagan would rise from Californiato become the GOP's iconic president,2
0,"that Jerry Brown, now 76-years-old, would become governor again after over 30 years?",2
1,"People havingto stay in hospital, eventhoughthey are well enoughto be discharged,becausethere's no social care in place for them",0
5,"David Cameron saysit's ""a demand problem""",2
1,"But it's not, of course",0
1,It's a supply problem,0

0,social care for older people has had its funding cut,2
1,there's simply not enough moneyto go round,0

1,Policymakers have been fretting over the future challenges posed by our ageing population for decades,0
1,Now this time has arrived,0
1,there's nothing there in the way of provision for it,0
1,"Care for elderly people is one of those thingsthat's not hardto sort out, given money,and almost impossibleto sort out without it",0
1,"It's one of those thingsthat, in theory, offers choice-staying at home with support, moving into sheltered accommodation, going into residential care",0
1,"In reality, however, people are so terrified of the prospect ofbeing in a positionwherethey haveto make such choicesthat they'd rather not think about it at all",0
1,One knows vaguelythat there aren't many decent alternatives,0
1,staying at homebecomes the one thingthat is comforting,0
1,Being close to the pastmatterswhenthe present and the future feel like a horrible staging-post before death,0

1,"One of the great paradoxes of old age isthat, at a time in lifewhenchange is very dynamic and hasto be managed a lot,people are persuadedthat tryingto stop time,instead of moving forward and adapting to circumstances,is the right thingto do",0

1,"Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo",0
1,The culprits appearto have done so in response to the magazine's publication of cartoons deemedoffensiveto Muslims,0

1,"As withmost incidents of violence involving Muslims,however, the ensuing public discussionhas revolved largely around resolutevowsto uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression -and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom",0
1,"As a result, the natural expressions of grief and sympathy on behalf of the victims have taken on the added quality of high-minded liberal support for the content of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, irrespective of the publication's history of racism towards Muslims and people of colour",0
1,It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalismthat one could reach the conclusionthat the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea,0
1,To frame these events without accounting for the broader context and power relationships at workinhibits any sensible understanding of the deep conflicts plaguing our world at present,0
1,Bypositing western liberal claims to freedom against Islam's supposedly intolerant attitude towards irreverent or serious critiques of itwould beto ignore completelythe history underlying the current tensions,0
1,"The reality isthat foras long asthere have been liberal ideals staking their claim to the various freedomswestern societies have cometo sacralise,there have also been societies suffering from exploitation and subjugation at the hands of those professing these lofty principles",0
1,"Even asthey were establishing the very foundations of modern liberal societies, from the tenets of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion to the basis for democratic forms of governance,Enlightenment thinkers were nearly universal in their expression of support for a world built on racial hierarchies and the expansion of new European empiresthat depended largely on the use of violenceto control colonial subjects",0
1,"That these philosophers developed their racist outlooks towards Jews, Muslims, and blacks on the basis of ""reason"" and ""rationality""makessuch views more abhorrent than thosederived from pre-modern modes of thought",0
1,it is the racist expressions of Enlightenment philosophers or the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo,0
1,these provocative views cannot be separated from the broader political projects at work,0
1,"that western liberalism gave rise to modern states committed to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law",0
1,"it also saw to the continuation of slavery, the colonisation and subjugation of large segments of Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, and global economic exploitation and environmental degradation",0

1,"in the face of this history,it should become clearthat in the case of cultural production, context always matters",0
1,Destructive policies cannot be pursued successfully without the vocabulary and imagery of racism and hatred of the other,0
1,One cannot attemptto comprehend the actions of mass murderer Anders Breivik or the recent report on the US government's torture of Muslim prisoners solely against the backdrop of western liberal ideals,0

1,"The historical continuity of racial discrimination, coupled with a ramped up pursuit of strategic objectives across a number of Muslim countries during the last two decades have seen to itthat an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility has permeated the public sphere in the USand revived the legacy of intolerance in Europe",0
1,"these tragic events should be examined in light of this context, rather than through the lens of free speech",0
1,"From Voltaire and the Enlightenment to the present, modern western discourses are replete with critiques of Islam",0
1,"By contrast, the abhorrent violence by some Muslims is a recent phenomenon, and onethat must be confronted byaddressing the failure of western liberalismto live up to its stated ideals, not byreflexively continuingto sing its praises",0
5,France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls has saidthat his country is now at war with radical Islam,2
5,"""Itis a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam, against everythingthat is aimed at breaking fraternity, freedom, solidarity,""Valls said during a speech on Saturday in Evry, south of Paris",2
1,"Whatis ""radical Islam""?",0
1,Is there such a thing?,0
1,And howdoes this affect the ongoing US-led war on extremism - the most tangible form being ISIL,0
1,who have controlled large segments of land and people in northern Iraq and eastern Syria?,0
1,"Very few people knowthat in Islam there are two kinds of ""jihad""",0
1,The smaller jihad is the more known - namely the onewhich reflects the military struggle,0
1,"But the greater jihad,which is less known,is the internal jihad - or struggle",0
1,"Few people also knowthat the Arabic word ""jihad"" is used throughout the Bible as well",0
1,althoughcertainly not in the militaristic sense,0
5,"2 Timothy 4:7 states:""I have fought the good fight,I have finished the race,I have kept the faith.""",2
1,"The verse in Arabic usesthe term ""jihad"" for the word ""fight""",0
1,"whetherit is this struggle or the fight for a better world,the militaristic jihad is certainly not a monopoly for Islamists",0
1,World leaders have correctly pointed outthat the fight against ISIL must be waged both on the military and ideological levels,0
1,But we must be careful about the idea ofconflating Islam with radicalism,0
2,People and ideas might be radical,2
1,to target a religion with radicalismadds insult to injury and shifts from the proper focuswhich is the individually created extremism,0
1,We have heard and seen a lot of the former,0
1,very little has been doneto tackle the ideologies behind this extreme group,0
1,The needto deal with the extreme thoughts connected to this movementwas made clear by extremistswho carried out the heinous attack against a French satirical newspaper; most likelybecauseof the ideas it has espoused,0
2,"Wheneverviolent acts take place,the natural response isto militarily obliterate the group or militia behind it",2
1,There might be a good case for a military response,0
1,it would be a totally counterproductive effort,0
1,it is not accompanied by an equally strong ideological response,0
1,It might be possibleto kill the holders of some of these ideas,0
2,everyone knowsthat you can't kill ideas byusing force,2
1,Extremist ideology must be tackled in a number of ways,0
1,The most important ideological response to extremism is the needto showthat there are better and more effective ways to deal with the various issuesthat makeextremism popular,0
1,This includes the needto introduce real political reform in the countriesthat are of importance to the peoplethat follow these extreme leaders,0
1,It applies both to the Arab countries,0
1,whose autocratic leadership has left a large sector of the public without any say inwhathappens to them,0
1,But it also applies to the needto continuestemming racism and Islamophobia from many of the western countries,0
1,wheresome homegrown terrorism seemsto be gaining strength,0
1,The issue is complicated by murderous acts like those committed in Paris,0
1,which tendto increase rather than decrease anti-Islamic sentiments,0
1,"In addition to political changesthat must be introduced,Arab and Muslim intellectuals and leaders must end their self-imposed silence and speak out clearly and unabashedly",0
1,There is no reasonto keeprepeatingthat these actions are not a reflection of true Islam,0
1,Whatis neededis for writers and thinkersto produce concrete and practical thoughts and ideasthat can be applicable to the 21st century,0
1,Today's Arab and Muslim youth needto find alternative role models and alternative ideasthat they can adopt in this struggle of ideasthat extremists are working tirelesslyto defend- and towhich the other side is only paying lip service,0
0,"One successful idea calledtakween (seen on the local Jordanian website, ammannet.net) has seen an increase in audience",2
1,"reformed independent writers from various backgrounds (culture, media, women's issues and workers rights) are producing daily analysisthat is the anti-thesis to ISIL's ideology",0
1,The individual efforts by some intellectuals isto be supportedbut much more is necessary,0
1,The anti-extremism military effort can't yield positive results,0
1,"there isn't a combined change inhowruling governments conduct their affairs(especially on the economic empowerment front),andhowto tackle every one of the extremists' thoughts, ideas and practices",0
1,The battle will be long and cumbersome,0
1,"in orderto win,all people of good will must work togetherto producewhatis good and uplifting for a better future for all",0
0,The prospect of the television election debates elicits from me two incompatible responses,2
1,"On the one hand, I believe stronglythat the Greens should be invited",0
1,it's on the basis ofhaving a seat in the house,0
1, they have the same right as Ukip,0
1,it's on the grounds of polling,0
1,they have a stronger claim than the Liberal Democrats,0
1,it's on the basis ofwho Ofcom thinksis a good chap,0

1,"I have mild viewson how much of a psephological impactthe debates have in the first place (some),andwhetherit constitutesa democratic deficit not to have them(no)",0
1," I knowhowthese debates will unfold,ifindeed they do:much like a mud wrestle, without the energy, or any prospect of a winner",0
1,"This election has already turned ""debate"" into a series of ""dids!""and""didn'ts!""",0
3,"""You caused the crash.""",1
3,"""We reduced the deficit.""",1
1,"It is beneath themto perform it, and certainly beneath us all to watch",0
1,"Once,finding nothing attractive forthcoming in the political offering,we could turn away to apathy",0
1,That was the boom-time option,0
1,"The ideathat politicians are identical,and allwe've got,once induced a comfortable stupor:now it feels like an anxiety dream",0
1,Something's Not Right,0
0,Insecurity and an Anxious Nation is a report published today by Compass as an overview of the economic situationin which most people find themselves,2
5,"Its author, Michael Orton, describes a 20-75-5 nation:s an intractable fifth of people in poverty, and an unaffected elite numbering approximately 5%",2
5,which has held since the 1990s,2
5,"The difference is that vast space in between, three-quarters of people,who are now beset by named and nameless fears",2
1,"There are concrete worries about debt, wages, childcare, food, energy and the impossibility ofever being a homeowner,or the inevitability of rent increases for the tenant with no options",0
1,"To allthis is addedless measurable,longer-term anxieties:that workplace security is getting weaker,that whatever is badnow will be worse for the next generation;that the new scale of indebtedness, gargantuan mortgages for thosewho can get them,student debts running to billions, will result in a new kind of servitude - but to whom?",0
0,"The problem with the status quo,an anti-corporate campaigner said to me once,isthat it's not static",2
1,It's getting worse,0
1,Not one of these fears could ever be calledunreasonable,0
3,the numbers are in,1
4,We are clearthat real median hourly wages have gone down by 10.2 percentand are now lowerthanthey were in 1997,2
1,People on average incomes are at a greater danger offalling into debt than the unemployed,0
5,"We are now pursuingwhatOrton calls ""a high living cost, low income, high debt, low savings approach""",2
1,"It's rather tactfulto call this an ""approach""",0
1,"""Hurtling off a cliff"" would work just as well",0
1,The prevalence of anxiety as a condition of modern life is undisputed,0
4,"according to the Office of National Statistics, 20% of people rate their level of anxiety as six or more out of 10, at any one time",2
4,As many as one in three will suffer from panic attacks at some point in their life,2

4,"In England last year, 40m prescriptions were issued for antidepressants",2
1,"CBT and exercise have their disciples, but clearly aren't panaceas",0
1,"There is no shortage of people - psychologists, sociologists, doctors - looking beyond the frailties of the human mind for wider causes",0
1,"It is commonplaceto cite consumerism and its attendant evils ofworking too hardto fund it,and missing the thingsthat are important,whileyou work",0
1,"however social the problem, the suggested solutions are always individual",0

1,stop spending,0
1,prioritise,0
1,downsize,0
1,take stock,0
1,You can't control the world,0
1,so trycontrolling your negative response to it,0
2,"It is also commonplace, T-shirt-sloganly common,to saythat to be anxiousis nothing more than a rational response to precarious conditions",2
1,"whatwill it takeforus to build that into a set of political demands, rather than tryto interrogate them away with introspection and positive self-talk?",0
1,"At the start of a panic attack, you are supposedto commence the catechism:whatam I afraid of?",0

3,Will the leadership debates take on a new piquancy,1
1,whenpolitics suddenly looks like the only answer?,0
5,"Norman Tebbit told the Observerthat we were going into the ""most awful election campaignthat anyone can remember""",2
0,His answer was bread and circuses,2
5,"""The public enjoy confrontations,""he said",2
1,"It's so wrong,it's intoxicating",0
1,"We have taken confrontation, and sometimes enjoyed it, in lieu of a politicsthat has anythingto say about livesasthey are mostly lived",0
1,But it's gone on long enough,0
1,"According to a study by researchers at King's College London, many doctors are failingto tackle their patients' weight problems",0
4,Researchers analysed the records of several thousand obese patients and foundthat 80% of them had never talked to their GP about their weight,2
0,"This finding comes in the same weekasit was reportedthat diabetes, an obesity-related disease, is using up a tenth of the NHS budget and causing record numbers of complications",2
0,is fat a medical issue?,2
0,Should nurses and GPs like me broach the subject?,2
0,And does intervention ever work?,2
1,Some arguethat obesity is a symptom of povertyand should be tackled at source,0
1,"whilegovernment, schools and other agencies clearly have a roleto play",0
1,I don't seehowGPs can ignore obesitywhenfaced with it,0
1,"There is no doubtthat the 22% of men and 24% of women in the UKwho are obeseare at increased risk of several cancers, heart, liver and respiratory disease, dementia and diabetes",0
0,"As a busy GP faced with an overflowing waiting room of ill people, it's temptingto avoidbringing up the subject",2
0,I haveto pickthe right moment and phrase itsensitively,2
1,"""Do you feelyour weight is an issue?""and ""Is there somethingwe can doto help?""are good openers",0
1,there needsto be timeto have the discussion,0
0,I admitI often put it off,2
1," arguably, one obese person referredforlife-changing bariatric surgery is a more useful intervention thanseeing a room full of people with coughs and colds",0
1,Not everyone is receptive,0
0,"Some say""I'm overweightbutI am fitter than most people my age""",2
0,"Or ""I know lots of thin peoplewho have died young and fat peoplewho are fine""",2
1,But these comments are the same as anecdotal tales of smokerswho live to 100 and young non-smokerswho die of lung cancer,0
2,"We are talking about increased risk, not a guaranteed death sentenceifyou're obese or smoke and certainimmortality ifyou're thinor a non-smoker",2
2,This sounds obvious,2
1,it's funnyhowirrational many people are,0
1,especially ifyou're telling them somethingthey don't wantto hear,0
1,I thinkGPs have a responsibilityto initiate a conversation about obesity,0
1,it is clearthat it is an important health risk,0
1,overweight people often underestimate their weight,0
1,losing weight can reduce that risk,0
1,there are interventionsthat can help,0
4," bariatric surgery,which is arguably the most effective way ofkeeping weight off,may cut the risk ofdeveloping type 2 diabetes by 80%",2
1,We also owe it to the next generationto intervene,0
1,Most fat children have fat parents,0
1,most will become fat adults in turn,0
4,"More than half of obese six- year-oldswill become obese adults, compared with less than 10% of non-obese kids",2
4,"having an obese parentdoubles your risk ofbeing an obese adult,even ifyou're a skinny child",2
1,So any interventionthat helps a parentto tackle their obesityis likelyto have a positive impact on the adults of the future,0
1,There is no need for doctorsto be nihilistic and thinkit's not worthbroaching the subjectbecausenothing can be done,0
1,"True, we don't know the most effective way oftackling obesity yet",0
1,Europe-wide trials are ongoingto tryto find outwhatthat would be,0
0,But there are options available: local council-run exercise programmes; referral to an NHS dietician; the prescription drug orlistat; or referral for bariatric surgery,2
0,"Last month, a new anti-obesity drug, Mysimba, was approved by the European Medicines Agency, and is likelyto be available on prescription later this year,despite the reservations of some experts",2
1,There will be some GP consultationsin which discussion about obesity just isn't appropriate or relevant,0
1,"a person is devastated by a recent bereavement, for instance",0
2,"it may be rude, crass, insensitive and offensiveto mention their weight",2
1,"having discussed the subject,there is no needto bang on about it at every visit",0
1,putting it off foreveris an abrogation of a doctor's duty of care,0

1,The first is the horror ofsurrendering myself to it,0
0,I haveto turn up at the hospital at 7.30am,2
1,They are trustingme to have eaten or drunk nothing for at least six hours,0
1,"Like an inmate at a prison, I will have my possessions checked in",0
1,They will give me a gownto wearthat is not my own,0
0,"Then I will saygoodbye to my husband,notknowingwhenI will see him again",2
1,"Depending on the hotshot neurosurgeon's schedule I may haveto wait a number of hours, empty-bellied and frightened",0
1,Eventually I will have one side of my head shaved,0
0,beforethey putme to sleep,2
1,"Don't makeTreat me like a wild animal running through the woods, take me out with a sedative dartwhenI am cooking or doing my favourite yoga pose",0
1,Then letme wake upwhenDon't tell meI am brave,0
1,The peoplewho chooseto get involved with meare the brave ones,0
0,"My husband, forpicking me up every timeI fall overwhenI lose my balance physically - and metaphorically",2
1,People like my yoga teacher,0
0,"who didn't run a milewhenI approached her for help,but instead restored some of my balance and mademe feel strong",2
1,My second worry is somethingI've never been good at in my life,0
1,Now I must faceit head-on,0
0,The doctors can't tell mehow longmy hospital stay will be,2
1,Will they needto open me up againbecausemy brain is bleeding?,0
1,Will I haveto have a shunt fittedbecausefluid isn't draining from my head?,0
1,Will the surgeon sneeze and nick my facial nerve?,0
1,Most suffering is in the worry,0
1,"It meansI haveto live in the lacuna of uncertainty, embracingnot knowing and carrying on",0
0,a new skillI practise daily,2
1,I knowthat ifyou take my life as a wholethis is an interruption,0
1,This will end,0
1,"I refuseto make itwho I am,my identity",0
1," it is an experience, onethat leaves its imprint on my body",0
1,"It has brought my life into sharp focus and revealedwhatI haveto be thankful for: people, strangers and intimates for their kindness andwell wishing;my tenacity and determination forcarrying me through;and as muchasI'm tryingto shake it off,my plan forcreating a freezer-full of foodto be eaten post-op",0
1,I am ready,0
1,"Last week's massacre of perhaps 2,000 people in and around the Nigerian town of Baga, and the bombings of markets in the north-east using children perhaps as young as 10, mark not a new tactic for the violent extremist organisation Boko Haram, but an intensification of its existing behaviour",0
1,"Boko Haram is pushing the boundaries of the extreme and is challenging - and seemingly succeeding - inoverstretching Nigeria's 7th Infantry Division,taskedto fight the insurgents in the north-east",0
1,"In recent months it has made significant territorial gains and is in control of many towns around the Borno state capital, Maiduguri",0
1,thoughthis is in a constant state of flux,0
1,asthe military defendsstate capitals and recaptures lost urban centres,0
1,"Speculation as to the aims of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, the real name of the network of Islamist, cultist and criminal elementsthat grew from a radical but initially largely non-violent movement,continues",0
1,And the logical conclusion isthat it is capturing territoryto carve out an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria,0
1,But the group is decimatingwhatis in its path,0
1,it is greedy,0
1,"the longer Boko Haram goes unimpededandthe more confidentit becomes,the more it seemsto want",0
1,So perhapswhatis its endgameis the wrong question,0
1,Boko Haram is fightingbecauseit can,0
1,"becauseit is a lethal fighting forceand haschildren and conscripts to send into the field as terrified, intoxicated and indoctrinated weapons and shields",0
1,"The questionthat needsto be answeredishowdid this terrorist threat grow to such horrifying proportions, killing thousands and displacing millions- a threat unimaginable in a democratic Nigeria 10 years ago?",0
1,And whatcan be doneto stop it?,0
0,"Nigeria's military is around 130,000-strong, and has been previously lauded for its peacekeeping successes in civil conflicts in Africa",2
1,", with a worsening conflict at home, questions are being asked aboutjust howhollowed out such an important institutionhas become",0
1,"There are varying reports as towhythe 8,500 troops deployedto battleBoko Haram have been unableto halt its advance",0
1,"Allegations of corruption; misallocated resources; poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly directed troops; fear; low morale; and deficient interagency cooperationallhave a basis",0
0,"Whilepromises have been madeto investigate reported abuses by the Nigerian armed forces against civilians, in December 2014an army court sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny and cowardice - forrefusingto fight Boko Haram",2
1,preventing Boko Haram fromexpanding furtherrelies on a more effective military response with a much-bolstered force,0
1,"But this is impossible without essential leadership from the centre, without tough calls and effective management",0
1,The international community will come underincreasing criticism fornot doing enoughto stem the tide of Boko Haram's terror,0
0,"Assistance has been offered by a range of partners including the US, UK, France, Russia and China",2
1,some of it has been declined,0
1,it is likelymore offers of assistance will come,0
1,"Nigeria believes its neighboursChad, Cameroon and Niger could be doing more",0
1,But domestic and international confidence in the will or capacity - or both - of Nigeria's federal governmentto takethe decisions to mount an effective responseis fast waning in the face of increasing casualties,0
0,Nigerians will go to the polls on 14 Februaryto vote for a new president and national assembly,2
1,"How muchthis violence, predominantly in three of Nigeria's 36 states, will affect the outcomeis unclear",0
1,Nigerians face a range of daily challenges,0
1,"There are concerns, however,that the majority of people in the states at the epicentre of the conflict - thoughtto be potential opposition supporters- will be disenfranchised, along with over a million internally displaced people",0
1,"However politicisedthe crisis may become in the runup to elections,the insurgency will outlast the event",0
1,"Last week, France faced the threatthat is arguably the toughest to defeat--a threat from within, from its own terrorists",0
1,"By now, the stories are familiar",0
1,France has a problem with homegrown radicals,0
4,"At least 900 French citizens are among the 2,000 to 3,000 westernerswho've left home for jihadist trainingorto fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq",2
1,"In many ways, the western jihadist represents the worst threat",0
1,"Able to speak the language fluently, completely familiar with their home countries, and possessing a key weapon -- an American, British, French, or German passport",0
1,they can easily cross international boundaries,0
1,The training makesthem deadly,0
1,the Paris attacks were notable for their deadly precision and meticulous planning,0
1,Their citizenship makesthem mobile,0
1,"That'swhyany American strategyto defeat jihadhasto include measuresto not just deny passports to American terrorists, but also strip them of citizenship",0
1,This is basic common sense,0
1,Most Americans would be surprisedto knowthat joining Al Qaeda or ISIS - the Islamic State - isn't grounds forlosing citizenship,0
5,The law currently providesthat Americans can lose citizenshipwhenthey enter or serve in the armed forces of an enemy foreign state,2
1,"But ISIS and Al Qaeda are not ""foreign states,""",0
1,the law doesn't apply,0
1,It's timeto close this loophole,0
1,"In Congress, legislation was introduced last sessionto address those concerns",0
0,It was not approved,2
1,"Now, in the new Congress - with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate - there's a renewed pushto safeguard the homeland",0
0,"Last week, Representative Ted Poe introduced a measurethat revokes passports from Americanswho join terrorist organizations",2
1," in the days ahead, Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Steve King are expectedto introduce legislationthat would strip citizenship from terrorist traitors",0
1,This is not an imaginary threat,0
1,Notonly have Americans joined ISIS,0
1,some have even lost their livesfighting for jihadists,0
1, as many as 40 men from Minneapolis alone have joined Islamic groups abroad,0
0,"And just last week in Chicago, A U.S  citizen was indicted by a federal grand jury - charged withattemptingto travel overseasto fight alongside the ISIS operating in Iraq and Syria",2
1,These men aren't just threats to the United States,0
1,they're also threats to our closest allies,0
1,"For our allies, the American passport is a ticket of entry, no visa required",0
1," similarly, for British, French, and other allies, their passport is a ticket of entry into the United States",0
1,The door is wide open for terroriststo take advantage of centuries of friendship and trust,0
1,It is timewe slamthat door shut,0
1,stripping citizenship and revoking passportsrepresent just two small steps - but critical ones - towards a sane national security strategy,0
1," it's difficultto takeeventhese small steps with the Obama administration steadfastly refusesto name our enemies (Mr  President, our enemiesare Islamic radicals,not generic ""extremists""),accurately describe their ideology(no, they are not ""nihilists""),oreven to acknowledge their obvious, widespread appeal in the Muslim world",0
1,It was sad and embarrassing for Americansto watchaseven the leader of the Palestinian Authority marched in Paris against Islamic extremism,0
1,our president or vice president were nowhereto be found,0
0,"Even liberal journalists calledthis absence ""pathetic.""",2
1,Marches don't defeat terrorists,0
1,dozens of world leaders stand together,0
1,it makes a statement of determinationthat is critical for our citizensto see,0
1,"our President makes a stand,it signals our nation's resolve",0
1,his absence signaled our government's weakness,0
1,"In the days and weeks ahead, Congress can send a very different message bypassing much needed legislation, putting it on the President's desk, and daringhim to veto legislationthat would prevent exactly the kind of attack France faced last week",0
1,"After almost six full years in office, we fully understand the President's approachto combatting terrorism",0
1,A recipethat mixes drone strikes with appeasement--that pulls troops from combat and sends captive terrorists back to the Middle--is now a proven failure,0
0,"In my bestselling book, ""Rise of ISIS: A ThreatWe Can't Ignore,""I demonstrated the consequences of that failure",2
1,"Jihad rages across the Middle East, Boko Harem rampages through Nigeria",0
1,Afghanistan teeters on the brink of disaster,0
1,"In the west, recent terror attacks in Canada, Australia, and Paris show jihadists abilityto inspire even western Muslims with a message of pure hate and evil",0
1,Will the Obama administration change course?,0
1,Will it finally acknowledge the true dimensions of the threat?,0
1,It can start with a dose of common sense,0
1,It can start byprotecting America from terrorist traitors,0
1,there were an award for scummiest business practice,0
1,refusingto pay internswould get many a vote,0
0,"But Jan Mortier,who until a year ago ran a ""junior associates"" programme through his thinktank Civitatis International,has upped the stakes bycharging former interns(or trainees,ashe prefersto think of them)a ?300 fee for an employment reference",2
1,Is charging someone for a reference afterrefusingto paythem as scummyasit gets?Sadly not,0
1,Young people are lucky,0
1,unpaid work is the worst dealthey are offered,0
1,"althoughthe ""junior associates"" programme was advertised on Internwise,the three-month programme cost more than?1,600",0
5,"(Mortier insistsit was a training course, not an internship.)",2
1,"But how on Earthdid Mortier thinkhe could get away withcharging for references,never mind the extortionate fee of?300?",0
1,His market is ambitious but terrified young peoplewho are overqualified and unemployed,0
1,"there is easy moneyto be made from them, for three reasons",0
1,"First, they've been sent the messagethat they're of little value to the economy",0
1,Government and businesses have spent the entire economic crisissuggestingthat young people lack employable skills,0
1,Repeated references to these elusive skills rarely lead to any kind of specific mention ofwhatthey are- or an investigation intowhyschools and universities stoppedteaching themjust asthe economy collapsed,0
1,you've spent your life in education onlyto be calledunemployable,0
1,the ideathat you'd haveto pay someoneto say nice things about youdoesn't seem so far-fetched,0
1,whileyoung people as a group tendnot to have much money sloshing around,0
1,their parents and grandparents are supposedly doing OK,0
1,People wantingwhat'sbest for their kidsleads easily to the coughing-up of cash,0
1,"whenit comes tolooking for a job,young people are so used to mounting hindrancesthat you can stick on another like an extra bottle on a drunk's bar tab",0
1,"Legend has itthat people usedto get a job byseeing onethey wanted,and applying",0
1,then came the timewhenthey needed qualificationsto get the same job,0
1,then they needed better qualifications,0
1,then they would haveto do an unpaid internship,0
1,then to prove itwasn't all a flukethey'd haveto get qualifications and do an internship,0
5,"Now, Civitatis would haveyou believethat ifyou attend its summer schoolyou ""will gain the advantage over others for internship (sic)""",2
0,300 for a reference?,2
3,Stick it on the bill,1
1,But the damage caused bycharging for referencesisn't limited to the spineless gouging of money from naive young people tryingto get their first job,0
1,A reference is immediately invalidoncemoney changes hands,0
2,The value of a reference lies in the assumptionthat it's an honest comment on a person's job performance or character,2
1,"The price tagMortier has attachedisn't,ashe claims, a ""fair administrative fee""",0
1,"It's enoughto make a pocket bulge, and certainly enough to be considered a bribe",0
1,no one pays?300to be damned with faintpraise,0
1,Anyone reading a reference signed by Mortier knowshe's been paid hundredsfor whateverhe's written,0
1,it will ring hollow,0
1,Getting a job with worthless education and months-long application processesis already hard enough,0
1,this idea catches on,0
1,references as a measure of a potential candidate will be as devalued as our degrees,0
1,The photos of40 of the world's government leaders marching arm-in-arm along a Paris boulevard on Sunday with the president of the United States not among themwas a provocative imagethat has fomented much debate,0
0,"The march was, of course, in direct response to the murderous attacks on workers at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo by a pair of brothers named Kouachi, and on shoppers at a Paris kosher supermarket by one of the brothers' comrades",2
1,The debate has been aboutwhetherPresident Obama should have been at the march,0
1,The march was billed as a defense of freedom of speech in the West,0
1,it hardly could have been held in a less free speech-friendly Western environment,0
1,the debate over Obama's absence misses the point,0
1,"In the post-World War II era, French governments have adopteda policy advanced upon them nearly 100 years ago by Woodrow Wilson",0
0,He pioneered the modern ideathat countries' constitutions don't limit governments;they unleash them,2
1,"even thoughthe French Constitution guarantees freedom of speech,French governments treat speech as a gift from the government, not as a natural right of all persons",0
1,asour Constitution does,0
1,The French government has prohibited speechit considersto be hatefuland even madeit criminal,0
0,"Whenthe predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo once mocked the death of Charles de Gaulle,the French government shut it down -- permanently",2
1,"The theory of anti-hate speech laws isthat hate speech often leads to violence,andviolence demands police and thus the expenditure of public resources,and sothe government can makeit illegalto spout hatredin orderto conserve its resources",0
1,"This attitude presumes,asWilson didwhenhe prosecuted folks forpublicly singing German songs during World War I,that the government is the origin of free speechand can lawfully limit the speechit hates and fears",0
1,"It also presumesthat all ideas are equal,andnone is worthy of hatred",0
1,"Whenthe massacres occurred last week in Paris,all three of the murderers knewthat the police would be unarmedandsowould be their victims",0
1,It wasas ifthey were shooting fish in a barrel,0
1,WhyThe answer lies in the same mentalitythat believesit can eradicate hate byregulating speech,0
1,"That mentality demandsthat government have a monopoly on violence, even violence against evil",0
1,"So, to thosewho embrace this dreadful theory,the great loss in Paris last week was not human life,which is a gift from God",0
1,"it was free speech,which is a gift from the state",0
1,"Hence the French government,which seemsnot to care about innocent life, instead ofaddressing these massacres as crimes against innocent people,proclaimed the massacres crimes against the freedom of speech",0
1,"Would the French government have reacted similarlyifthe murderers had killed workers at an ammunition factory, instead of at a satirical magazine?",0
1,howhypocritical was it of the French governmentto claimit defends free speech!,0
0,"In France, you can go to jailifyou publicly express hatred for a groupwhose membersmay be defined generally by characteristics of birth,such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion",2
1,You can also go to jail forusing speechto defy the government,0
0,"This past weekend, millions of folks in France wore buttons and headbandsthat proclaimed in French:""I am Charlie Hebdo.""",2
0,"Thosewhose buttonsproclaimed""I am not Charlie Hebdo""were asked by the policeto remove them",2
0,"Thosewho wore buttonsthat proclaimed, either satirically or hatefully,""I am Kouachi""were arrested",2
1,Arrested for speech at a march in support of free speech?,0
1,Yes,0
1,What'sgoing on here?,0
1,"What'sgoing on in France,andwhatmight be the future in America,is the government defending the speechwith which it agreesand punishing the speechwith which it disagrees",0
1,"What'sgoing onis the assault by some in radical Islam not on speech, but on vulnerable innocents in their everyday livesin orderto intimidate their governments",0
0,"What'sgoing onis the deployment of 90,000 French troopsto catch and kill three murderers",2
1,becausethe government does not trust the local policeto useguns to keep the streets safe or private persons to use gunsto defend their own lives,0
1,Whydo some in radical Islam kill innocents in the Westin orderto affect the policies of Western governments?,0
1,"Might it bebecausethe fruitless Western invasion of Iraq killed 650,000 persons,most of whom were innocent civilians?",0
1,Mightit bebecausethat invasion brought al-Qaida to the regionand spawned ISIS?,0
1,Might it bebecauseObama has killed more innocent civilians in the Middle East with his dronesthanwere killed by the planes in the U.S  on 9/11?,0
1,"Might it bebecauseour spies are listening to us, rather than to thosewho pose real dangers?",0
1,Whatdoes all this haveto do with freedom of speech?,0
1,Nothing --unlessyou believe the French government,0
1,We are luckyto have today's Germany,0
0,WhenChancellor Merkel arrived in London last week,2
1,she came as the accomplished leader of Europe's most successful liberal democracy,0
1,Germany's economic strength is taken forgranted,0
1,we also takeforgrantedthat this is an essentially good country,0
1,It is not goingto assuage any demons bybehaving aggressively to its neighbours or blaming foreigners for any of its problems,0
1,"It is quietly and determinedly goingto attemptto anchor Europe in the same successful combination of liberal democracy, social solidarity and productive capitalismthat it enjoys",0
1,it has the economic and moral wherewithalto do just that,0
1,This very new country -afterall German reunification was completed just 25 years ago- could be so different,0
1,It could have a poisonous political movement aimingto restore Napoleonic glories riding high in the polls - see the Front National in France,0
1,"It could be captured by venal, vested-interest groupslocking the economy in permanent stagnation like Italy",0
1,It could be in thrall to a know-nothing political rightwhose objectiveisto run the country in the interests of its top 1% like the US's Republicans,0
1,It could be led by a self-regarding nationalist such as Russia's Mr Putin,0
1,"It could live in a cultural time-warp like today's Britain, hankeringto restore the lost certainties of the 1950s",0
1,Germany is none of those things,0
1,it were,0
1,Europe would be fundamentally and worryingly unstable,0
1, this is a firmly liberal democratic country looking forward in the 21st century,0
5,"becauseits relationship to history,asdirector of the British Museum Neil MacGregor argues in his revelatory and illuminating book Germany,compelsit never to look back",2
1,"Germany can only face its otherwise unintelligible historical crimes, genocide and futile millions of war dead with a resolveto never again make the same mistakes",0
1,"Its capital city, Berlin, forces its citizens every dayto confront the factthat it exterminated six million Jews in its striking Holocaust memorial",0
1,no other world capital so uncompromisingly has built monuments at its heartto forceit constantly to confront past disasters,0
1,"Whatdoes it meanto beus is a questionevery country asks,searching its historyto reproducewhatever successit might have once enjoyed",0
5,"MacGregor's argument isthat becauseGermany cannot take comfort or define itself by imagined past glories,it is free of imprisoning and destructive myths",2
1,"It has become, of necessity, a force for good, too little recognised in Britain in part",0
1,becausewe still define ourselves as a victor over Germanywhenit was evil,0
0,Angela Merkel choseto spend some hours of her time inLondon visiting the Germany exhibition at the British Museum,2
0,an exhibition MacGregor has curated alongside his book,2
5,"MacGregor believesBritain does not understand today's Germany, the complexitiesthat delivered itorwhyit thinksasit does",2
1,Merkel agrees,0
1,The point of her British trip was notto devise ways ofhelpingCameron win his EU referendum in 2017,0
1,about which she was stubbornly reticent,0
1,It was very publiclyto endorse MacGregor's view of today's Germanybeforehis exhibition closeslater this month - and perhaps trigger a different debate,0
0,"MacGregor organises the exhibitionso that the first big quoteyou seeisGoethe and Schiller's 1796 declaration: ""Germany?Whereis it?/ I do not knowwhereto find such a country.""",2
0,There are eight different maps of ever-mutating German territory since 1500,2
1,"Thus the home of Immanuel Kant, its greatest philosopher, is Kalingrad (then Konigsberg)",0
2,which is now in Russia,2
0,"the citythat most influencedits greatest poet (Goethe), Strasbourg, is now in France",2
1,"From 1500 to 1806, ""German-ness"" expressed itself through the loose association of principalities, cities, dukedoms and minor statesthat was the shifting boundaries of the Holy Roman Empireuntil its defeat by Napoleon",0
0,Then came the nation statethat wasfirst imperial,2
0,then Hitler's Germany,2
0,"Postwar division followed defeat, then reunification",2
1,"For Germany, the nation state has been an aberrant, destructive interlude between the Holy Roman Empire and now the European Union - a 21st-century variant of the Holy Roman Empire, but with a single currency, market and trading rules",0
1,"For Germany, it is the only wayto conceive of the future, and create a peaceful and productive Europe",0
1,"Senior German officials talk privately in these terms, categoriesthat bewilder the British still locked in fundamentally traditional political categories",0
1,"For its neighbours, one downside of Germany's recent past - 1920s hyperinflation - is its quasi-religious attachment to sound money and budgetary rectitude",0
1,"But the greater German attachment, trumping everything, isto think and build forwardrecognising today's realities",0
1,Thus the Greek political crisis - and the possible confrontation between Germany and the anti-austerity Greek leftifit wins the elections- may have a happier outcomethanthe British consensus could ever imagine,0
1,Syriza has the 30 super-rich Greek familiesthat pay no tax and run Greece as a payola for their own interests in its sights as muchasit is targeting Greece's suffocating external debt burden and excess of austerity,0
1,It is also keenly awarethat abandoning the euro for the drachmaanddetaching itself from the EU exposes Greece to both huge inflation and the tender mercies of Turkey,0
1,The potential deal with Germany is clear,0
1,"The left will forge a proper liberal Greek democracy with the 30 families paying tax,secure the forgiveness of much of its external debt but stay in the euro",0
1,the price will bethat it continues with tough constraints on public spending,0
1,France is shaken to its core by recent events,0
1,Germany will wantto see the atrocities as the acts of a murderous cult fuelled by marginalisation rather than join in any putative clash of civilisations,0
1,It knows better than any other European countrywherethat leads,0
1,"whyit will successfully handle its own backlash against Islam, Pegida",0
1,there is a British referendum on EU membership,0
1,Germany will offer whatever British government the deal necessaryto keep Britain in,0
1,"Its mission isto tryto hold Europe together,keeping at bay the temptations of Islamophobia, nativism, political extremism and protectionism",0
2,It may not succeed,2
1,But imagineifit did not tryorifGermany itself gave in to the same temptations,0
1,"It would loveBritain to recallthat at different times it has fought alongside Germans,to drop its fixation with two world wars and now make common causeto build a great future",0
1,Europe would be so much stronger,0
1,we dared,0
1,Nigeria is at war,0
0,"In the past week alone the Islamist militants Boko Haram have slain hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people across north-eastern Nigeria, some with the help of child suicide bombers, including a 10-year-old girl",2
0,"In recent months they have sacked entire towns and villages, and are now masters over 20,000 square miles of territory",2
4,"About 1.7 million people now liveinBoko Haram's declared""caliphate""",2
4,1.5 million have been displaced from their homes as a result of the violence,2
1,"With a monthto go before presidential elections,Africa's most populous country is losing the war against a fullblown Islamist insurgency",0
1,So whatis the Nigerian government doing about it?,0
0,"In 2013 President Goodluck Jonathan,who is up for re-election,declared war on Boko Haram and dispatched the Nigerian armyto battle them",2
0,But Boko Haram not only fended off the army's offensive,2
1,it ended upbeing emboldened by the obvious ineptitude of the Nigerian forces,0
1,"Soldiers meantto be protecting cities and townshave sometimes taken to their heelswhenBoko Haram's fighters arrived on the scene,leaving inhabitants at the mercy of the Islamists",0
1,But the problem isn'tthat Nigerian soldiers are cowardly,0
1,"it isthat they are woefully under-equipped, under-trained and far too demotivatedto tackle the well-armed Boko Haram fighters",0
5,"The governor of Borno, the state most affected by Boko Haram, has publicly statedthat the Islamists are much better armed than the soldiers",2
1,The reasonthe Nigerian army is in such poor shapeis simple,0
0,"The military's annual budget exceeds ?4bn, but rather than equip and train frontline troops,there are complaintsthat much of the funds end up in senior officers' pockets",2
1,"Soldierswho complainhave been knownto be court-martialed and sentenced to death for ""mutiny""",0
1,"As commander-in-chief, this iswhereJonathan could have been expectedto step in",0
1,But rather thanconfront the army top brassthe Nigerian president has optedto bury his head in the sand and place the blame for Boko Haram's success on everyone bar himself,0
0,"Whennews emerged last year of the kidnap of the Chibok girls, instead ofreacting swiftlyJonathan hesitated for two weeks,suggestingthere was no kidnap, only a plot by his political opponentsto discredit him",2
1,"At other times he has shrugged off Boko Haram's deadly attacksaslittle more than the unavoidable localised version of global jihad, implying with his tone and body languagethat hundreds of citizens getting killed every week is something Nigerianswill simply haveto get usedto",0
0,"Aftera deadly bomb blast killed more than 100 people in the capital Abuja last year,Jonathan was pictured dancing away at a political rally the next day",2
0,"Travelling around the country over the past few weeks,my impression isthat Nigerians are increasingly looking to the main opposition presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, a former general and one-time military ruler, as the country's best hope oftackling Boko Haram",2
1,"Under ""normal"" conditions Buhari, a conservative Muslim from the northwho ruled Nigeria with an iron fist from 1983-85,would have little hope of support in the country's southern, predominantly Christian region",0
0,"Without outstanding charisma, eloquence or competence on policy detail, the 72-year-old Buhari has already made three unsuccessful bids for president",2
1,"But after a yearin which Boko Haram and government corruption has dominated local headlines,the ex-general has two things going for him: a reputation for strong leadership and incorruptibility",0
1,He is probably the only prominent Nigerian politician todaywho isn't hounded by allegations ofembezzling public funds,0
1,A president with military experienceto take on corrupt army officerswould surely serve as a morale booster to the Nigerian soldiers battling Boko Haram,0
1,the ex-general has no magic wandto makethe militants simply vanish,0
1,"But in this period of existential crisis, Nigeria may need a wartime leaderwho can project reassuring strength and provide a plausible strategy forovercoming the insecurity in the country",0
1,Time is running out,0
1,"With two hostage crises playing out in parallel, one given an especially sinister dimension by the targeting of a kosher supermarket, today's pictures from Paris underlined a jihadi threatthat is ugly and real",0
0,"Beforethe standoffs reached their bloody climax,it was reportedthat one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen had trained with militants in Yemen",2
0,A link had also emerged between these two brothers and the police-killer behind the supermarket siege,2
1,in which several hostages are thoughtdead,0
2,Islamist terrorists may be rare,2
2,nobodywho cares for peace or freedomcan doubt the duty on the stateto disrupt such menacing networks,2
1,"Against this backdrop,the head of MI5 is boundto command attention",0
0,on Thursday night Andrew Parker gave a speech about rising threats to British security,2
0,He pointed with justified pride to disrupted plots,2
0,"He stressed, too,that there could be no guaranteethat every attack would be averted",2
1,To have pretended otherwisewould have been wrong,0
1,"But Mr Parker is also, in his way, a political player, well awarethat spelling outhowa UK attack was ""highly likely""will strengthen his hand in the ongoing push for powers",0
1,And he used the attentionthat he had grabbed in this wayto make a disingenuous case for the sort ofsnoopingwhose exposure by Edward Snowden in 2013caused outrage around the world,0
1,The director-general whispered sweet reason,0
0,"He emphasised the oversightthe agency faces, and rejected,he said,the lazy insistence that more security hadto mean less privacy",2
1,The tone was good,0
1,it was the substancethat was wanting,0
5,"He explainedhowdecrypted emails of extremists had been usedto foil one major airline plot,andhowinformation was forensically recovered from a second bunch of fanatics, bent onblowing up London landmarks, after their arrest",2
1,"Such pinpointed(andlegally controlled)intelligence work might, perhaps, also have made a difference in Paris",0
1,whereboth the Charlie Hebdo murderers were on watchlists,0
1,"Mr Parker, however, lurched fromdetailing such targeted work tomaking oblique allusions to the entirely sweeping, and until 2013 entirely unacknowledged, probing of communication records, and the interference with internet trafficon the often-spurious pretextthat it is ""international"" in a purely technical sense",0
1,These are the practicesthat give the state such chilling potentialto keep exhaustive tabs on so many citizens,0
1,"But the effect of Mr Parker's intervention isto kick back against necessary reforms, and to pile on the pressureto put these controversial practices on to a permanent footing",0
1,"As for the oversight he gave such weight to,its weakness was evident today",0
0,"the chair of the intelligence and security committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, uncritically echoed virtually everythingthat he had said,blithelyassertingthat it wasn't the intelligence agencies' jobto spy on ordinary people",2
1,as ifthe Snowden revelations had never happened,0
1,Britain is still crying out for a debatethat the security services continueto duck,0
1,The dreadful events of Paris do not change that position at all,0
1,The longest and biggest oil boom in history is over,0
1,In a boom - andthe latest one lasted almost 10 years-everything shines for producer nations,0
0,the economy grows,2
0,consumption explodes,2
1,businesses make fat profits regardless of their productivity,0
1,poverty declineseven ifsocial protection programmes are ineffective,0
1,politicians are popular and getre-electedeven ifthey are incompetent and corrupt,0
1,people tendto be happier,0
1,oil prices tendto be cyclical,0
1,"whenthe downturn comes,the party ends",0
0,"During the oil price decline of the 1980s, most oil-dependent countries suffered the consequences of the resulting collapse in investment and consumption",2
0,"A few, such as Oman and Malaysia, were ableto compensate for the price collapse by increasing production",2
1,"many oil exporters suffered,alsodue to the production cuts agreed by Opec",0
1,Some recovered better than others,0
1,in general between 1982 and 2002 they fared much more poorly than the rest of the developing world,0
1,Thosethat fared worstwere typically the onesthat got into debt during the boom,0
1,Poverty and unemployment rose sharply,0
1, such underperformance led to the widespread ideathat having oilis a curse,0
0,which has generated extensive literature,2
1,The reality is more complex,0
1,asshown by economic overperformance during the past decade's boom,0
1,"taking out those two ""bust"" decades,oil countries have outperformed their peers over the past 70 years",0
1,"So the real ""curse"" is in fact an oil price collapse",0
1,"The current price collapse - for the first timesince2009 prices are below the symbolic $50 a barrel- is largely a result of the boom in shale oil production in the US, adding more than 3m barrels over the past few years",0
1,High prices bring investment and supply,0
1,this boom was no different,0
1,Oil prices are notoriously difficultto predict,0
1,we do not knowifthe current bust will last,0
1,despite evidence prices are still above historical standards,0
4,For the majority of the more than 120 years of history of the oil industry the price has been below $50 in today's money,2
1,But geopolitics or renewed consumption could alter the oversupply scenario and surprise us once again,0
1, oil busts tendto leadto booms down the road preciselybecauseinvestment in oil exploration dries up,0
1,"Net importers, like most European countries, will benefit from the oil price decline",0
0,"In the US, citizens will pay significantly less for gasolinethanthey haveover the past five years",2
1,leadingthem to spend more on other goods,0
1,A vast transfer of wealth from exporters to importers is occurring,0
1,the fall is short term,0
1,some pain will be suffered by all net oil exporters,0
1,it will only be disastrous for the countriesthat failedto learn the lessons of the previous boom and bust cycle,0
1,"This time around many countries have saved a larger part of their windfall and invested more in productive assets, although generally significantly less than the value of the resource being depleted",0
1,Many abandoned their conservative fiscal policies during the financial crisis of 2008-09,0
1,which made sense,0
1,they never got back to the prudence of the first few years of the boom,0
1,Middle Eastern producers were promptedto increase spending by the unrest produced by the Arab Spring,0
1," with few exceptions, most exporters are in better shapeto weather the storm",0
1,"The wealthy countries of the Gulf, and some of the Caspian countries, can easily manage a temporary fall in prices ",0
1,they have accumulated large external funds,0
1,some face more worrisomelong- term fiscal prospects,0
1,Even Russia is in a better positionto manage the oil fallthanthe Soviet Union was,0
1,it would still suffer from the necessary cuts in imports and spending,0
1,the sanctions will hurt more,0
1,Iran is in worse shape,0
1,becauseit had a less prudent economic policy,0
1,sanctions had already produced a crisis even before the fall in the oil price,0
1,"Nigeria, despite an improved macro policy in comparison with the previous boom, is goingto be significantly affecteddue to its excessive dependence on oil",0
1,leading to an increase in poverty and political instability,0
1,Angola is also vulnerable,0
1,"Latin American oil exporters with generally prudent macro policies, like Colombia and Mexico, will also be affected by the necessary fiscal adjustment",0
1,they should be ableto manage it with limited trauma,0
1," no country is in worse shape entering into the price collapse than my home country, Venezuela",0
0,"As the proverbial grasshopper of the fable, Venezuela did not only spend throughout the summer, mostly in consumption",2
1,it also went into a debt bingeto afford even more consumption,0
4,the country was running deficits of 15%-20% of GDP during the peak boom years,2
1,Now comes the winter,0
1,it faces economic collapse,0
4,Inflation could top 100% in 2015,2
1,shortages are widespread,0
1,"there is a high probabilitythat many Venezuelanswho came out of poverty during the boomwill fall back into it, with serious consequences for political stability",0
1,Oil abundance is not necessarily a curse,0
1,Most producers are better prepared this time around,0
1,"for the fewthat learned nothing from the past,the reality will be as harsh as the grasshoppers' winter",0
1,"President Obama's plan, announced Friday,to make community college free for promising students,will be seen by some as a game-changer",0
5,"the president noted in his speech,his proposal --""America's College Promise""-- is based on Gov  Bill Haslam's Tennessee Promise program",2
0,which offers free tuition to students attending two years of community or technical college,2
1,the president's plan will certainly makecommunity college accessible to many more students,0
1,it is also far from clearthat such students will benefit,0
1,"Despitethe president's best intentions -- absent serious reform -- pressuring community collegesto improve outcomes,graduation rates have no reasonto rise",0
1,directing more students to community colleges withoutstudents will become eligible for two free years of tuition,0
1,"they maintain merelya 2.5 GPA, hardly stellar in this age of rampant grade inflation--the president's planmight, perversely, worsen graduation rates",0
5,"To that end, the president insiststhat participating schools will needto ""adopt promising and evidence-based institutional reformsto improve student outcomes.""",2
1, the success of his proposal depends ondemanding a greater degree of accountability from community colleges,0
1,thoughit's not exactly clearwhatsuch reforms might entail,0
1,"Regardless ofhowit all turns outModd-NU,the president's proposal will not solve the larger problems facing American higher education, namely, ever-rising college tuition and student debt",0
1," despite his pledgeto ""[help] every Americanlarge federal subsidies for community colleges might exacerbate such problems",0
1,"Flush with new funding,community colleges might, for instance, be temptedto imitate their 4-year peers and increase spending on administrators, frivolous capital projects, and other extravagant amenities",0
1,"Tuition hikes would, in turn, invariably follow--the brunt ofwhich would be borne by students ineligible for the new federal subsidies",0
1,"Yet under the Obama plan, even many newly subsidized students would likely not escape unscathed",0
4,"At present, nearly 60 percent of community college students do not finish their degrees within 6 years of enrolling",2
1,"As such, it's likelythat newly subsidized students--many of whom will not graduate over the course of their two year subsidies--would inevitably needto worry about tuition increases as well",0
1,more American families and students question the value of a college degree,0
1,it's essential--asthe president rightly does--to emphasizethat college graduates outperform their non-degree holding peers on a wide range of outcomes,0
1, policymakers would be wiseto findways to maximize the value of students' tuition dollars,0
1,"Alas, simply enabling more studentsto attend college, withoutcreating the right incentivesto ensure better outcomes,is not one of them",0
1,The first thingto say about the collapse of Circle's pioneering contractto manage Hinchingbrooke district hospital in Cambridgeshireisthat it must be desperately worrying for patients and staff alike,0
1,"Even thoughthe Care Quality Commission foundthat the hospital was ""inadequate"" across the board, including care and safety",0
1,which probably precipitated Circle's decisionto pull out,0
2,- uncertainty alliedwithill health is a terrible combination,2
1,"NHS England, and the Department of Health, have a heavy burden of responsibility over the coming daysto restore confidence and clarifywhathappens next",0
1,The second point isthat it is a political catastrophe for the Conservatives ,0
0,althoughthe process of privatisation began on Labour's watch,2
1,- all the worse forcoinciding with evergrimmer news onwaiting times at accident and emergency departments in England,0
1,The cost and disruption of the Lansley reforms must bear some responsibility for the worst winter crisis ever,0
1,Hinchingbrooke's failure surely torpedoes any immediate prospects of a big expansion of privatisation,0
1,"It looks like a clear victory for all thosewho have repeatedly warnedthat privatisation and profits are incompatible with a free, universal healthcare system",0
1,"It could be Tweeted as Goldman Sachs (training ground of Ali Parsa, Circle's former chief executive), nil, NHS, one",0
1,The truth is more complex,0
1,Circle won the contract in a process of franchising out Hinchingbrooke hospital management at leastpartly becauseno NHS bidder thoughtthe sums could be madeto add up,0
1,"Hinchingbrooke,which sits almost equidistant between major hospitals in Cambridge to the south and Peterborough to the north,is a hospitalthat has needed downsizing or even closing for the last 20 years",0
1,"Now Circle is pulling out,less than a third of the way through a 10-year contract, reportedly?7m poorer and with a stock pricethat has taken a double-digit hit in the past 24 hours,surely confirmationthat privatisation delivers no magical solution",0
1,"Circle's obligations includedpaying down a debt of?40m, accrued over just three years, within the next 10",0
1,The heroic scale of that commitment was laid bare in a National Audit Office report in 2013,0
5,which showedthat Circle would haveto deliver?30m of savings every year,2
0,"Only months after the start of the contract in February 2012, it was clearthe hospital was well behind its savings target",2
1,Althoughcare improved,0
1,it was clearthe financial plan wasn't working,0
0,Mr Parsa stood down as chief executive of Circle,2
0,"By the end of its second financial year, the deficit was just short of ?5m, the pointat which Circle could pull out",2
0,MPs on the public accounts committee have questionedhowthe contract cameto be awarded at all,2
1,Part of the answer isthat it was clearan NHS solution was not on the cards,0
1,it would have taken more cashthanwas available post-crash,0
1,But there's a lesson in the waycontracts are awarded too,0
1,At least one study suggestsa lack of expertise in Whitehall meansthat contracts go to the shiniest rather than the most competent contender,0
5,Circle complainsthat it wasn't in control of the environmentin which it worked,2
1,"Like every hospital trust, it struggled under new treatment tariffs,the Nicholson challenge to make?20bn of savings over a five-year period, and fluctuating demand influenced partly by GP and community care availability",0
1,"The Lansley reforms have set up a competitive relationship between the new carecommissioning groups and providers such as Hinchingbrooke, unforeseenwhenthe contract was agreed",0
1,"The process ofwinding up the Circle franchise and bringing the hospital back into NHS managementwill laybare the weaknesses of the new structures, the lack of any proper local accountability and the inabilityto reorganise services on a coherent, holistic basis",0
1,"The impact of complexity, centralisation and cost-cutting are now graven on the statistics",0
4,"The figures published today showthat every aspect of A&E; care - not just waiting times, but delayed ambulances, ambulances waitingto transfer patients,and patients waitingto be transferred out of A&E;- are the worst on record",2
1,The Conservative vision for the future of the NHS is looking like an electoral liability,0
0,"On 20 September 1943, my great uncle Alex found for the first and last time in his lifethat the smartsfor which he would always be renowned in his familywere no longer enough",2
0,he was arrested in Nice and sent to the death camps,2
1,Alex knewwhatawaited him there,0
0,his older brother Jakob had done this journey already and died in Auschwitz a year before,2
0,"So he dug up the floorboards of the train with his stubby fingers, slipped through the hole, lay on the trackwhilethe train rattled over himand walked back to Paris, hidden along the way by communists",2
0,He then joined the Resistance,2
1,he never trusted France again,0
0,"In later life, he gave back the Legion d'Honneurhe was awarded for his war service after Charles de Gaulle described Jews in 1967 as ""elite, domineering and sure of themselves""",2
1,Are you tired of Holocaust stories?,0
3,"Apologies forbringing up all that ""unpleasantness"" again",1
0,I've been thinking about Alex this week,2
4,"According to a YouGov poll,45% of Britons agreed with at least one antisemitic statement put to them, such as ""Jews chase money more than other people"" (endorsed by a whopping 25%),and""Jews' loyalty to Israel makesthem less loyal to Britain than other Britons"" (20",2
1,"I feel less certain about another survey this week, by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, conducted on social media",0
4,which claimedthat 54% of British Jews feelthey have no future in the UK,2
1,But the tenacity of antisemitic beliefs is striking even in Britain,0
4,"where,according to a separate report last year by Jewish Policy Research, 47% of the British Jewish respondents feltantisemitism was not a very big problem",2
4,40% didfeel antisemitism had increased in the past five years),2
1,This would have astonished Alex,0
1,He adored Britain,0
0,he had been in Britain as part of the Free Frenchbeforehe was captured,2
0,he often spoke about the comforthe gotlistening to the BBC World Service during his fighting days,2
1,I imagineit will astonish most Britons too,0
1,"eventhosewho, in a dark and unacknowledged place inside, instinctively agree with the statementsposed by YouGov",0
1,You don't haveto travel too farto find them in the UK,0
1, you can just turn on the BBC,0
5,"One Jewish woman, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, told BBC reporter Tim Wilcox this weekthat the horrific murder of four people in a kosher supermarket made her worry about the return of Jewish persecution",2
5,"""Many critics, though, of Israel's policy would suggestthat the Palestinians sufferhugely at Jewish handsaswell,"" Wilcox said",2
1,"- all but saying: ""So swings and roundabouts, really.""",0
0,"Wilcox later apologised on Twitter for a ""poorly phrased"" question",2
1,as thoughthe problem here was one of grammar,0
5,"Only two months previously this same reporter, in an on-air discussion about Miliband losing Jewish support, said:""A lot of these prominent Jewish faces will be very much against the political mansion tax, presumably.""",2
1,They most certainly will!,0
1,You knowwhatthose Jews are like,0
1,"always watching their massive pile of shekels, with their prominent faces and their prominent noses",0
1,"Now we turn to Paris,wherethe terrible events of last week would not have surprisedAlex nearly as much",0
1,"There were an astonishing number of attacks on Jews and synagogues in France last year, with the resultthat twice as many Jews emigrated to Israel in 2014 than the year before",0
1,Since the awful killings there has been plenty of talk from the media and politicians abouthowwe all mustn't letthis atrocity give rise to an anti- Muslim backlash,0
1,This is right and good,0
1,"But can we takea few minutes to lookat the lash itself, as well as dealing with the backlash?",0
0,Four Jewish people were killedbecausethey were in a Jewish supermarket,2
1,"this inconvenient truth has been relatively littleremarked upon, certainly compared with the angsting over the parameters of free speech at Charlie Hebdo, or commentary about the irony of the terrorists killing a fellow Muslim, the police officer Ahmed Merabet",0
1,Is this because killingJews is seen as par for the coursewhenit comes to terrorist attacks?,0
1,Becausethat doesseemto be true,0
0,"Going back to the attacks in Mumbai in 2008,the killers specifically sought out a Jewish community, Nariman House, and tortured and killed six Jews, including the Rabbi and his wife",2
1,The Taj Hotel has become the symbol of the Mumbai attacks,0
1,"according to some reports, it was actually Nariman Housethat was the terrorists' main target",0
1,"Already the killer of the Jewish people in the supermarket is being referred to, incorrectly, as ""the Charlie Hebdo killer""",0
1,So just par for the course?Maybe,0
1,but I don't thinkthat's quitewhat'shappening here,0
1,"Jews are, as the YouGov report madevery clear,seen as a pretty dominant people",0
1,"in charge of the media, you know",0
1,And Hollywood too,0
1,"Elite, domineering and sure of themselves",0
1,"whenthey are attacked,there is a sensethat - well,they kinda brought this on themselves",0
1,there are other groupsthat are less elitethat need more looking after,0
1,I'm not surewhythis is an either/or situation,0
1,A person can be horrified by anti-Muslim prejudice and also terrified by the attacks on Jews,0
1,to talk about oneis not an endorsement of the other,0
1,For a BBC reporterto balance the killing of Jews in Paris against the atrocities in Palestineis the definition of idiocy,0
1,"Not as bad asexpressing outright sympathy with the killer of the Jews, as the reliably idiotic ""comedian""Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala did on Facebook,but still bad",0
1,"This is not the victim Olympics, with only one possible ""winner""",0
2,"These were peoplewho were killed,not political statements",2
0,My great uncle Alex led a wonderful life after the war as an art dealer,2
1,he never again trusted the countrythat had betrayed him so badly,0
5,"WhenI asked oncewhyhe refusedto keep his paintings in a bank vault,preferring insteadto keepthem hidden in his house,he replied:""Because they always come for the Jews.""",2
1,Plus ca change,0
1,Has there ever been so much debate about a debate?,0
1,"The negotiations about this year's TV leader's debates sank to a new low last week, with David Cameron appearingto use the factthat the Greens now look likelyto be excluded as an opportunityto bow out",0
1,"Far from a principled stance, this came across as a self-serving attemptto get out of jail free,followingasit did in the wake of his equivocation aboutwhetherhe would participate in the debateshe once so enthusiastically embraced as challengerrather than incumbent",0
1,Cameron's decisionto pull out of an online video debate for first-time votersalso reflects poorly on his motives,0
1,he really wantedthe Greens involved,0
1,he would have co-ordinated a call from all three party leaders to the broadcastersto include them in the debates?,0
1,In the face of such cross-party consensus it would have been unthinkableforthem to refuse,0
1,It is a damning indictmentthat the political parties cannot even agree on a format for a series of election debates,0
1,One hasto questionwherethat leavesthe real challenges facing the countrythat will require a degree of cross-party consensus to tackle over the next decade,0
1,in a timewhenincreasing political instability looks setto be the norm,0
1,Long-term reform of the NHS and care systemsto cope with an ageing population or restructuring the banksto insulate us against another financial crisisare issues far more complex and thorny than a debate format,0
1,This episode reveals two further truths,0
1, all our leaders have claimedto wantto change the nature of the conversation between politicians and voters,0
1,But too often these claims are undermined,0
1,"Ed Miliband argued for a new politics in July 2014,shunning the shallowness of husky-themed photo-ops",0
1,"He launched his election campaign with a promiseLabour activists will engage in four million conversations,talking to people on doorsteps rather than communicatingusing poster campaigns",0
1,"But the authenticity of this has been undercut by Labour's continued reliance on negative campaigning, including their election broadcast ridiculing Nick Clegg as the ""Un-Credible Shrinking Man""who has abandoned his principles, and leaked strategy documentstelling candidatesto move onwhenvoters raise immigration as an issue",0
1,Cameron's attemptto extract himself from debatesthat attracted tens of millions of viewers in the run-up to the last electionundermines these claims by the political class even further,0
1,It smacks of politicians only interested inpursuing a new style of politicswhenit suits their strategy,0
1, the disagreement around the debates is a symptom of the extentto which Britain's two-party majoritarian system is breaking down,0
1,The vote share of the two main parties has steadily declined in recent decades to the extentthat it no longer looksas ifthe two parties will be ableto sustain a majority under the current electoral system,0
1,We are now in the territorywheretheir declining vote share means first pastthe post is beginningto deliverwhatincreasingly looks like arbitrary rather than democratically credible outcomes,0
1,It is nonsensical for the Greensto be excluded on the basis of their vote share in an electoral systemthat providesstrong disincentives to vote for them in the first place,0
0,Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition for themto be included,2
4,eight in 10 voters thinkthey should take part,2
1,"Ofcom's decisionthat they don't have sufficient supportto accord them ""major party status"" and the broadcasters' reluctanceto invitethem to participatehave the ring of a political establishment desperately tryingto cling on to the cartel-like status quo",0
1,"A political rulebookthat better reflects the more pluralistic politicsdeveloping in Britainwould do more than any speech or campaignto facilitate a more honest, authentic conversation with the public",0
1,Cameron's attemptto wriggle out of the debatesis shameful,0
1,"he must accept the invitation issued by the Guardian, Telegraph and YouTubeto take part in an online debate including the Greens",0
1,But he should be doing much more,0
1,he should be leading a national conversation involving all the party leaders abouthowthe pluralism of the electorate can be represented in a more democratic system of politics,0
1,"The longerthe main parties tryto resist,the more disillusioned and disenfranchised the public will become",0
1,Muslims - in theory - have traditionsthat value the power of the pen,0
1,Islam was revealedto save people from bloodshed and misuse of the sword,0
0,"That is a paraphrasing of the cardinal's line in one of the Acts of Edward Bulwer-Lytton 1839 play ""Richelieu""",2
1,"The origin of the timeless adage is thoughtto have originated in Assyrian wisdom - like Islam, moral and value systems of Middle Eastern descent",0
1," the moral, intellectual and ethical systems of that region - including those carried through dialogue with Hellenic ideas in the first three centuries of Islam - have all been subjected to obscurantist and literalist interpretations of revelation",0
1,"Islam's first command to the Prophet Muhammad wasto ""read""",0
5,"""Read in the name of thy Lord.""",2
0,"Chapter 68 in the Quran is named ""Al-Qalam"" (the pen)",2
5,"It opens up with the verse:""By the pen and what they inscribe.""",2
0,In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen,2
5,"""Who taught by the pen.Taught mankind thatwhich he knew not""(96:4-5)",2
1,So it should be natural for Muslims todayto feel total empathy towards fellow writers and journalists and the families of other victims in France,0
1,Especially in solidarity against the cowardly slaying of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and cartoonists,0
1,"Reading and writingbelong to the ""genus"" of cross-disciplinary activitiesIslam insists upon repeatedly",0

1,"Landswherescholars of Islam underwrite political power at the expense of freedomof speech and a rational interpreting of the Quranthat delivers Muslims from the yoke of oppressionthat is consuming Muslim youthand pleads the case of social justice, freedom of thought and tolerance",0
1,"The sad state of the violence that today engulfsMuslim cities, pitting Muslim against Muslim, is in no small measure the result of the over-politicisation and over-securitisation of Islam",0
1,Whole states are disintegrating,0
1,religious and sectarian intolerance is ushering in a horrible era of annihilation and self-destruction,0
1,Islam never began with jihad (a holy war),0
1,"The miracle of the Prophet Muhammad isthat he knewwhento retreat(via Hijra or emigration) to build values of solidarity, peaceful coexistence with all kinds of ""otherness"" (such as in Medina and hostile Arab tribes), create know-how, and voluntarism in faith and membership of community, along with moderation (""wasatiyya"")",0
0,"Quran is the word for ""reading""",2
1,"Those Muslimswho, in cold blood, killed French journalists and cartoonists,supposedly to ""avenge the prophet""miss the point about the prophet's ways",0
5,"That includes the injunctions that ""Verily, this Quran guides [human beings] to thatwhich is most just""(17:9),and""Ifanyone took a lifeunlessit be for murder andspreading injustice in the land,it would beas ifhe killed mankind entirely"" (5:32)",2
1,"Satire, criticism, and cartoons will never caricature the grand stature of the prophet nor diminish the sacredness of the Quran to Muslims and billions of tolerant human beingswho share countries, ideologies or friendships with hundreds of millions of Muslims",0
1,Denigration comes from the savagery of heinous violence,0
1,Manichean ways many self-professed learned scholars of Islam or self-serving politicians knowingly and unknowingly are pushingtrusting Muslim youth and entire nations towards the abyss,0
1,"France has historically accommodated millions of Muslimswho fled poverty, marginalisation and even oppression",0
1,Many of those come from North Africa,0
1,"Maghreb countries have benefited not only from remittances, but also from a vast shared spacein which Muslims, Christians and Jews have learnt the art of toleration of differences",0
1,Whatthe murder of innocents in Paris has doneis inflame inter-communal trust,0
1,"like the 9/11 attacks in the US 14 years ago, it has placed Muslims in the awkward position ofbeing either unwelcome among host communities or defending Islam",0
1,"This is because of the insane acts of co-religionistswhose Islamis fixated on the ""sword"" and has littleto do with the might of the ""pen""that over millennia Muslim luminaries usedto connect with others, and spread knowledge",0

1, Charlie Hebdo's new cover will complicate matters further and in a short period will sideline many Muslims at a critical time in this global struggle against terrorism,0
1,Charlie Hebdo and the press have the rightto publishwhatthey like,0
1,but Muslims are freeto be offended bywhatis published,0
1,it is their rightto be critical of such depictions,0
1,No one should tell Muslimswhatthey should or shouldn't get offended by,0
1,asit is up to themto determine it for their community,0
1,"Bydepicting the prophet in a cartoon drawing,Charlie Hebdo chose racism and Islamophobic discourse against all Muslims",0
1,"This action transformed the discussion from one focused on terrorism, jihadism and murder into a narrow theological and legal debate concerningwhatcan and can't be represented in images about the prophet",0
1,This is an issue involving all Muslims not only the terrorists,0
1,Another wasted opportunityto build on unity and bring Muslims into the global fold,0
1,Charlie Hebdo's editors choseto stay in the mud of racism and Islamophobia,0
1,Some arguedthat they had no choice,0
1,they neededto stay true towho they are byprinting such a cartoon,0
1,however this would be even morethe case that the terrorist forced the subject of the cover rather than the other way around,0
1,"Freedom of the press proponents will celebrate the release of the new cover and view it as a triumph over terrorism byinsulting all Muslims through another racist cartoon depicting the prophet,as a hooked-nose Arab looking man",0
1,Let's be clearthat the overwhelming majority of Muslims will continueto uphold their traditionthat it is impermissibleto represent the prophet's likeness in the form of an image,0
1,whilecertainly few had the opinion in the pastthat it is not prohibited,0
1,This will not change anytime soon,0
1,it is none of anyone's business other than Muslimsto decide on this matter,0
1,Charlie Hebdo's cartoon attemptedto bring the prophet into the debate around terrorism and Muslim violence,0
1,which in my view is a shortsighted strategyto deal with a most serious problem,0
1,"Byselecting the prophet as the site of contestation,Charlie Hebdo took a page from the clash of civilisation advocates and built a cartoon narrative around it",0
1,Indoingsothey joined the coalition with the global Islamophobic industry and neo-conservative networkthat have been pushing this framing for almost 30 years and for sure since the collapse of the Soviet Union,0
1,We are in agreementthat the terrorists claimedto act on behalf of Islam,0
5,asMalek Merabet statedhis brother likewise is a Muslimand defended the newspaper from an ethical and moral ground,2
1,that I fully believeare informed and grounded in Islam,0
1,"Indecidingto print the new cover poking fun of the prophet's image,Charlie Hebdo sided with the terrorist framing of Islam and not with the Muslim police officerwho lost his lifedefending themand would have been likewise offended by the new publication",0
1,I dobelievethat ifAhmad Merabet were alive todayhe would still show up at the newspaper,0
1,to protectthe individuals and their freedom to insult his faithwhiledeeply aggrieved by it,0
1,"In this context, every timethat we make the connections between terrorism and Islamwe are only validating the terrorist's own epistemic and pushing the 99.99 percent of the Muslims away byinsisting to insult the prophet and through it their faith",0
2,One can have the freedomto say and do something whileunderstanding the painthat it causes othersifit is actually carried out,2
1,Today would have been a great dayto have a cartoon of Ahmed smiling at the terrorist while defending the newspaper and the cartoonists in the name of his Islam,0
1,This is not giving into the terrorist but standing with Muslims inopposing terrorismand byaffirming the painand sufferingthey experienced as a result of the heinous crime committed in their name,0
1,"Yet on a deeper level, the terrorist purportingto speak for Islamis a crime in itself",0
1,which for many Muslims would be akin toaccepting the KKK claimsto be the authentic voice of Christianity,0
1,"Byframing the response to the terrorist through an explicit link to Islam,we are granting them the credentialsthey wantand directing more attention to their cause",0
1,The proper response should have beento remove their Islamic claims and celebrate and embrace the real Muslim heroes,0
1,who defended and protected lives at both the Charlie Hebdo offices and the shoppers at the kosher supermarket,0
1,Who are we poking fun at?,0
1,The Muslimsasdiverse minorities in France living at the margins of society are the object of the satire,0
1,not the powerful or the terrorists,0
1,It is not the powerful but the powerlessthat is the object of the laughter,0
1,Freedom of speech is not absolute,0
1,responsibilities are attached to it and more sowhenthose living at the margins are subject to racism and discrimination,0

1,The piece illustrated a vivid picture of human resilience after over a decade of extreme privation and suffering,0
1,"Asinspirationalasthey were,the photographs also servedasa stark contrast to the daily realities experienced by the former inmates during the course of their detention",0
1,realities still experienced by the 127 men still heldthere,0
1,"On Guantanamo's 13th anniversary, the US government must continueto work diligently without any more excusesto ensure due process for the remaining detainees and shut down one of the darkest holdovers from the ""war on terror""",0
5,"In a joint declaration issued last year by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, several other UN agencies and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the US was urgedto ""adopt all legislative, administrative, judicial, and any other types of measures necessary to prosecute, with full respect for the right to due process, the individuals being held at Guantanamo Naval Base or,whereapplicable,to provide for their immediate release or transfer to a third country""",2
4,"Yet, of the total of 779 men and boysthat have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002,only nine have been convicted of any crime",2
4,"Of the 127 remaining detainees, 59 have been unanimously cleared by US intelligence and security agencies, of any involvement in terrorism but continueto await their release",2
4,"The remaining 68 inmates are classified as ""indefinite detainees"", a Kafka-esque category used for detainees ineligible for either trial or release",2
1,"These men will face Periodic Review Board hearings, an incipient interagency processthat will assesswhetheran inmate poses a threat to the US or is eligible for transfer",0
1, this procedure lacks guarantees to due process and will likely prolong situations of arbitrary detention,0
1,"asinmate transfers continue,the US must abide by the principle of ""non-refoulement"",ensuring detainees' rightto not be returned to a placewherethey will face persecution, torture or death",0
0,This guarantee was not upheld withcleared inmate and Centre for Justice and International Law and Centre for Constitutional Rights' client Djamel Ameziane,2
0,who was forcibly repatriated back to his birth country of Algeria despite stated fears of persecutionand standing precautionary measures ordered in his favour,2
0,"Upon his return, Ameziane was detained by Algerian government agents as part of an ""evaluation process"" and subjected to abusesthat left him in poor health",2
1,Ameziane's forcible repatriation is only one of several other cases,0
0,"In 2014,two other men were involuntarily repatriated to Libya",2
0,"in 2007, two others were sent back to Tunisia",2
1,"Resettling detainees back to countriesthat will expose them and their families to threats, persecution, and - in the case of detaineeswho are not cleared- to ongoing detention and torture,will only deepen years of suffering and injustice",0
1,"The US Senate committee's grisly report on the CIA's interrogation methods and the trickling repatriation of cleared inmates represent important steps towardsmaking the truth of the ""war on terror"" available to the public",0
1,"However, the question overhowmaterial and intellectual authors of torture will be held accountable in accordance with international lawremains",0
2,"As party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the US is not only forbidden from practising torture but requiredto prevent and hold accountable any individualswho are involved in these particular kinds of human rights violations",2
5,"Under this convention, US federal authorities are requiredto conduct ""prompt and impartial investigations"" of these crimes",2
1," under the Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention - the articlewhich barstorture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment against prisoners of war - the US could be held accountable for war crimes",0
2,"under international law, amnesty laws are not permittedandthe authors of torture must be prosecuted - at home or abroad",2
1,The public availability of documentationto establish the truth behind Guantanamo Baywill no doubt play a pivotal role indismantling the architecture of state-sanctioned human rights abuses,0
1,the US Senate's scathing report revealed some of the most shocking instances of torture,0
1,"its 6,700 pages are the tip of the iceberg",0
0,"In early December, a US judge ordered the disclosure of over 30 tapesdepicting the controversial nasogastric force-feedings of hunger strikers in Guantanamo,including Abu Wael Dhiab - one of the six men released to Uruguay",2
0,Whileattempts are being made by the Obama administrationto overturn the ruling,2
0,human rights groups continueto demand for release of the tapes,2
1,"Almost six years afterUS President Barack Obama signed an executive orderto shut down Guantanamo Bay,it is unfathomablethat this international symbol for US human rights abuses remains open",0
1,The ongoing reluctanceto punishthose responsible forauthorising and using tortureis even more unfortunate,0
1," now more than ever, the US government can send a powerful message statingthat no one is exempt from international accountability and prosecution",0
1,"Whatis done nowwill startto ensurethat torture - or ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"" - are never used by the US or other military and intelligence personnel in situations of conflict",0
1,the US will finally be ableto close one of the grimmest chapters in its history,0
1,"Last week's attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris and the subsequent, linked hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket were appalling acts of inhumanitythat should be universally condemned",0
1,"Despite the killers' grandiose claimto be ""defenders of the prophet"",their actions amounted to cold-blooded murder of defenceless people",0

1,"who exercised,in vivid, unapologetic terms, the fundamental, priceless right to freedom of speech and expression",0
1,"This right,thoughnever absolute,was established through centuries of struggle and is still far from fully accepted around the world",0
1,"There are many others - governments, dictators, religious fanatics -who would also liketo shoot it down",0
1,"That the killers' made Jews their additional, parallel targetlends a woefully familiar, disgustingly antisemitic twist to a three-day trail of carnage and grief",0
1,"Byso doing,they hoped yetanother community would be left in fear",0
1,"This attack was thus also an attack on the French nation as a whole, on the values and beliefsthat have sustained it,andon the message of liberty, equality and fraternity it has unevenly but persistently propagated",0
1,its principal victims were irreverent secularists,0
1,it was also an attack on faith - an offence against moral as well as human law,0
1,"It was an attack on the life spiritual itself,whetherconducted through church, mosque, synagogue or personal observanceIt was an act of utter godlessness",0

1,The choice is stark and unavoidable,0
1,"It is between the ongoing struggle for enlightenment - Europe's gift to the world - and a gathering, hate-filled darkness",0
1,The evident danger isthat this spirit of unity may not endure,0
1,French Muslim leaders have roundly condemned the attackers,0
5,"""These men are criminals...For me, they are not Muslims,""said the imam of Drancy",2
0,"But at less emotional moments, French Muslims also speak of routine, entrenched discrimination, of insensitive restrictions such as curbs on women wearing the veil,andof a French policy of assimilation and integration, the flipside of Britain's let- it-all-hang-out multiculturalism",2
1,which has failedto achieve equal rights and equal treatment,0
1,"It is this same embattled Muslim community, fractured, underprivileged, marginalised and disrespectedwhich produced the killers",0
1,"It is clear, conversely,that many French people have a problem with Islam",0
4,"According to an Ipsos survey last year, 63% of French voters saidIslam was not compatible with French values",2
4,Almost three-quarters saidMuslims wantedto impose their values on others,2
4,Surveys also suggestseven out of 10 voters believesections of the immigrant community have failedto integrate over the past 30 years,2
4,Some 65% sayimmigration levels are out of control,2
1,"Anti-Muslim and anti-immigration movements are growing in strength in Germany, Britain and across Europe",0

1,"But this common challenge will not be assisted by wrong-headed, kneejerk reactions by western security services",0
1,"In France, there is justified criticismthat the Kouachi brothers were not under close watch, given their past record of extremism",0

1,"At last,the thinking goes,fashion has realisedthat beauty may also come with silver hair",0
1,You don't buy that?,0
1,At least it seems finallyto have graspedthat women don't simply give upshopping the momentthey turn 50,0
0,But it's not Didion's agethat interestsme,2
0,It's her status as a writer and thinker,2
1,"Bychoosing her-acclaimed and bestselling, but also trenchant, highly mannered and somewhat complicated - Celine's creative director, Phoebe Philo, is sending out quite a bracing message",0
1,"the semaphorein which it's writtenwill, alas, be largely illegible to thosewho know nothing of Didion",0

1,The implications are dreadful for the Coalition,0
1,Just ask Campbell Newman and Mike Bairdhowdelightedthey are to campaign in a climate of GST hypotheticals,0
5,Some conservative commentators have claimedthat all the Abbott government needsto doto stemthe freefall in the polls isto get its messaging right,2
5,"Surely in 2015,they say,a better sales pitch - and a fresh-faced young assistant treasurer in Josh Frydenberg - will turn around the public's opinion of the government and its budget",2
1,Whatthese folks misunderstandisthat good policy makesgood politics and no policy makes terrible politics,0
1,"Right now, the Abbott government has no overarching policy agenda, no coherent narrative, no holistic approach to the nation's current budgetary challenges",0
1," it has surprise measures (reintroduction of fuel indexation), broken promises (cuts to the ABC, health, education and the pension), wild new spending commitments (PPL), counter- productive new taxes (GP co-payment), and random thought-bubbles of the kind currently proffered by minister Robb and co",0
1,Whereto start insolving the problem?,0
1," instead ofpushing a lot of random levers in its budget and hoping some of them work,the government needsto put forward a ""grand bargain"" to the people of Australia",0
1,"fixing our budgetmeanswe needto fix our complicated, inefficient federation",0
1,"We needto work outwho is goingto do what to whom, andwho is goingto pay for it",0
1,"It also meansfixing our tax system, not just tinkering with high-income levies or raising the GST by a couple of per cent",0
1, the federation and tax reform white papers should come out as soon as possible,0
1,"Frankly, these should have come out much, much earlier",0
1,"Whatwere Coalition members doingasthey sat on the Opposition benches waitingto win the ""unloseable election""?",0
1,"Secondly, as part of this ""grand bargain"", the government needsto get real aboutending the age of entitlement",0
1,"Right now, it is just code forpunishing the poor and protecting the rich",0
1,The tax system doesn't just haveto be fair,0
1,it hasto be seento be fair,0
1,Asking the lowest income peopleto pay GST on fresh foodwhilecontinuing to give high-income superannuants and investment-property ownersmassive tax concessions would keepthe age of entitlement alive - for those at the top of the income scales,0
1,"Rather disturbingly, one word seemsto connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm",0
1,"I say disturbingly,becausepointing out some common groundmay be seen asblurring the crucial distinction between murderous bastards and innocent satirists",0
0, it strikesme as fascinatingthat the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion,2
1,"yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasmthat inspiresJews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter thosewhose only weaponwas the pen",0
1,So what'sthe connection?,0
2,In one sense an iconoclast is someonewho refuses the established view of things,2
2,who kicks out against cherished beliefs and institutions,2
1,Which sounds pretty much like Charlie Hebdo,0
1,"But the word iconoclast also describes those religious peoplewho refuse and smash representational images,especially of the divine",0
0,The second of the Ten Commandments prohibits graven images ,2
1,which iswhythere are no pictures of God in Judaism or Islam,0
1,"And theologically speaking, the reasonthey are deeply suspiciousof divine representation isbecausethey fearthat such representations of God might get confused for the real thing",0
1,"The danger,they believe,isthat we might end upoverinvesting in a bad copy, somethingthat looks a lot likewhatwe might think of as god",0
1,"which, in reality, is just a human projection",0
1,So much better thento smash all representations of the divine,0
1,"And yet this, of course, isexactly whatCharlie Hebdo was doing",0
1,"In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insistingthat the images people worship are just human creations - bad and dangerous human creations",0
1,"And intaking the piss out of such images,they actually exist in a tradition of religious iconoclasts going back as far as Abrahamtaking a hammer to his father's statues",0
1,Both are attacks on representations of the divine,0
1,"Which iswhythe terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken inthinkingCharlie Hebdo is the enemy",0
1,"ifGod is fundamentally unrepresentable,then any representation of God is necessarily less than God and thusdeservesto be fullyandfearlessly attacked",0
1,"whatbetter way ofdoing this than through satire,likescribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God",0
1,It's only some Christiansthat might demur from this logic,0
0,For the Christian story (ie Christmas) tells of God coming into the world as a human being,2
1,And indoing thisthe divine takes on a representational form,0
5,"Jesus,says St Paul,is the image of the invisible God",2
1,Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable,0
1,So I can seehowsome Christians might finddisrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting,0
1, they believeit's possible for images genuinelyto capture something of God,0
1,images can't capture God- andthat's the Jewish/Islamic position- then bring on the cartoonists,0
1,They should be encouragedto do their worst and disrupt our confidencethat whatwe think of as Godbears any resemblance to anything legitimately God-like,0
1,They are like Moses bringing down the golden calf,0
1,It is the ancient job of the iconoclast,0
1," of course, these terrorists weren't really interested in theology",0
1,"They thoughtthat Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribethey called fellow Muslims",0
1,And maybe they were,0
1,"whateverelse was happening,it was the atheist cartoonistswho were performing the religious functionand the apparently believing Muslimswho had forgotten their deepest religious insights",0
1,For any representation of the divinethat leads people to murdereach other deserves the maximum possible disrespect,0

1,you might actually need an ambulance,0
1,I absolutely can't think of a simpler way ofdescribing it,0
1,It seemsthat NHS 111 works slightly differently from NHS Direct,0
1,which preceded itand was staffed by nurses,0
0,in that very few of the peoplewho answer the phoneare medically trained,2
1,They have no more chance offixing a human body themselvesthansomeone in an EE call centre has ofgenerating a 3G signal using an alkaline battery and a radio transmitter,0
0,They work off a computer system called Pathways,2
0,"which tells themwhat questionsto askand then,the answers having been typed in,whatadvice to give",2
1,"Astriage goes,this is flawed",0
1,"The first stage of it - the decisionto opt for 111 rather than, on the one hand, 999 or, on the other, a paracetamol and a lie-down- is conducted by the patients themselves",0
1,This ensuresthat the new service gets a nice mix of thosewho are definitely dyingbut don't wantto be any trouble and malingererswho are losing the courage of their convictions,0
1,Then the next stage is a sort of medical version of those magazine surveysthat claimto tell youwhetheryou're romantic or sociopathicor spiritual or a typical Scorpio,0
1," regardless ofwhethermost of your answers are As, Bs or Cs,the system still just advisesyou to consult someone trainedto diagnosewhetherthere's anything really wrong with you,rather than waste any more time describing your nasty rash to a guywhose last jobwas cold-calling about missold PPIs",0
1,"that'swhatcauses the trouble for A&E;: the combination of a risk-averse computer algorithm, call centre staffwho don't want blood on their hands and the scarcity of GP appointments on public holidays, weekendsandwhenthere's good skiingto be had,is driving thousands of 111 callers into A&E;to be put on a trolley and ignored like a rum baba in a 70s restaurant",0
1,The solution is simple,0
1,the algorithm needs some backbone,0
1,Bywhich I don't meanthat the decisions should be taken by actual live vertebrates- that's obviously unworkably expensive,0
1,But we needto be honest with ourselves,0
1,the whole point of this phone line isto fob people off ,0
1,"to stopthem going to hospital,not encourage them",0
1,"Deep down, they wantto be toldthey're fineand to stopmoaning - otherwisethey would've dialled 999",0
1,a new version of Pathways needsto be designed with that in mind,0
3,We're sorrythat you too have foundit necessaryto call NHS 111,1

0,January 15 marks a decadesinceMahmoud Abbas became the Palestinian president,2
1,"during which timethe goalshe claimsto espouse not only remainunrealised, but are more remote than ever",0
0,He is still in office despite his term ending six years ago; the democratic processthat brought him to power no longer in existence,2
1,He speaks of his people's human rights,0
1,whilehis Palestinian Authority actively curtails them,0
1,He claimsto champion their national rights whilecollaborating unconditionally with the countrythat denies them,0
1,"Abbas' image as a hapless, harmless figure deflects from the cunning and ruthlessness of someonewhose primary concern, like the Middle East's other autocrats,seemsto be his longevity",0
1,The factthat he plays ball with the West and Israelsomehow makesthis okay,0
1,Whereother Arab strongmen nurture an image of powerto maintain it,0
1,he relies onbeing seen as an underdog,0
1,"But this illusion,which has traditionally served Abbas well,no longer extends to his people",0
1,"Many think heandthe PA serve their own interests and those of Israel, rather than those of the Palestinians",0
4,"According to a poll last month, 55 percent believethat the PA has become ""a burden on the Palestinian people""",2
4,"Regarding the presidency, Abbas has consistently lagged in opinion polls behind his Fatah colleague, Marwan Barghouti",2
4,"Since Israel's last Gaza invasion, he also runs behind Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh",2
1,"Is it mere coincidence, then,that Abbas has been lacklustre incampaigning for Barghouti's release from Israeli jail; or inpursuing and implementing national unity deals with Hamasthat call for elections?",0
1,"Since the signing of the latest reconciliation agreement in April, Abbas has at various times threatenedto end it,and has been openly adversarial towards Hamas",0
0,Electionsthat were due within six monthsnever happened,2
1,he remains unchallenged,0
1,this has gonelargely unnoticed,0
1,The PA -which is meantto safeguard Palestinian rights- serially abuses them,0
5,"Human Rights Watch has documented ""police beatings and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators"", ""excessive force"", ""repressing critical news reporting and demonstrations"", ""suppressing dissenting views"", and ""serious rights abuses, including credible allegations of torture""",2
5,"for which ""no security officials were convicted""",2
1,"As such, the PA is not only failingto curb Israeli abuses,but is busyperpetrating its own, all under Abbas' watch",0
1,The PA has garnered a reputation among Palestinians formanaging the occupation rather than strivingto end it,0
1,"One way it doesthis is ""security coordination"" with Israel",0
0,"which Abbas described last year as ""sacred"" despite the vast majority of Palestiniansopposing it",2
1,"Such coordination serves Israel byenablingit to subcontract its occupation,and serves the PA byhelpingit suppress internal dissent",0
1,It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people,0
0,"Abbas and his foreign minister have made grotesque assurancesthat as long ashe is president,he will not allow an uprising against Israel",2
1,"So the PA,which is supposedto be part of a national liberation struggle,is willingto put down an uprising by its own people against their subjugation",0
1,This is nothing short of betrayal,0
1,"For more than 20 years, the PA has participated in a ""peace process""that has greatly entrenched Israeli control",0
0,Abbas himself was an architect of the disastrous Oslo Accords,2
1,The occupied territories are now so colonised and fragmentedthat a viable Palestinian state is widely consideredimpossible,0
1," Abbas still wantsto negotiate,despite Israel being clearly opposed to Palestinian self-determination",0
1,"What,then, is the point ofnegotiating?",0
1,"Perhapsto preserve the privileged elitesto which the PA and the ""peace process"" gave birth",0
1," allegations of corruption and nepotism, including Abbas and his family, are nothing new",0
1,"With the help of international aid, the PA is the largest employer of Palestinians, much like other autocraciesthat encourage public dependence on the stateto avoid mass unrest",0
1,A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel,0
0,"He opposes armed resistance, and has gone to great lengthsto disarm militants in the West Bank",2
0," he also opposes peaceful forms of resistance, including the increasingly effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement",2
1," it took the PA more than two years since Palestine's upgraded UN statusto applyto join the International Criminal Court,despite repeated threatsto do so amid constant Israeli provocations",0
1,"That Abbas finally relentedmay not only, or necessarily, be aboutlosing patience with Israel,but aboutassuaging mounting Palestinian anger at his procrastination inapplying to the ICC",0
0,"Meanwhile, he sayshe will keeppushing for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a deadlineto end Israel's occupation",2
1,despite the certainty of repeated failure by US veto,0
1,Abbas seemsto be attempting a balancing act,0
1,"He wantsto prove to Israel, and his western and Arab backers,that he is their best Palestinian partner,safe in the knowledgethat they will not accept Hamas rule,but mindful notto suffer the same fate as Yasser Arafatoncehe was no longer deemeduseful or reliable",0
1," his recent, uncharacteristic defiance against Israel reflects a needto stop his flagging domestic popularity turning into an uprising against him and the PA",0
1,"Abbas has nothingto show his people after 10 years as president, and at least another decade as part of the ""peace process""",0
1,"He remains in office because of, not despite, Israel's occupation and Palestinian disunity",0
1,We have a blasphemy law,0
1,No electorate has approved it,0
1,No parliament has passed it,0
1,No judge supervises its application,0
1,no jury determines guilt beyond reasonable doubt,0
1,There's no right of appeal,0
1,And the penalty is death,0
1,"It is enforced not by a police bound by codes of conduct, but by a fearthat dare not speak its name",0
1,a cowardice so totalit lacks the courageto admitit is afraid,0
1,The British are the world's worst cowards,0
1,It is one thingto sayyou don't approve of Charlie Hebdo's cartoons,0
1,"But the BBC, Channel 4 and many newspapers won't run any images of Mohammad whatsoever",0
1,They would at least have acknowledged censorship,0
1,they had announcedthat they were frightened of attacks on their staff,0
1,"They would haveclung to a remnant of their honourifthey had said:""We are not censoring out of respect.We loathe the murdererswho enforce their taboos with Kalashnikovs.But we do not wantto spend years living in hiding,asSalman Rushdie did.Or be stabbed in the street,asTheo van Gogh was.Orhear an Islamist smash at our door with an axe and cry:""We will get our revenge,"" -asKurt Westergaard did.So we are backing away.""",0
1,"Admittedly, an honest admissionthat terror workswould shred the pretencethat journalists are fearless speakers of truth to power",0
1,But it would be a small gesture of solidarity,0
1,"It would say to everyone, from Pakistani secularists murdered foropposing theocratic savagery,to British parents worried sickthat their boys will join Islamic State,that radical Islam is a real fascistic force",0
1," most journalists have lived a lie for years,ashave many in the arts, academia and comedy",0
1,"We take on the powerful - and askyou to admire our bravery-if,and only if, the powerful are not a paramilitary forcethat may kill us",0
1,"The mass murder of cartoonists and police officers at Charlie Hebdo, and the attacks on Jews,which revive so many foul memories of European fascism,will change our world - almost certainly for the worst",0
1,we findthe courage to overcome fear,0
1,"the self-censorship will spread, and not only in the media",0
0,Colleagueswho wanted historians at a London museumto talk about the long history of depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art last weekwere met withpanicking press officers tryingto shut them up,2
5,"Historian Tom Holland,who received death threatsafterhe challenged the creation myths of Islam,said:""I cannot think of any other area of historywheredebate is so nervous.""",2
5,"He hopesthat historians will continueto saythat the Koran was a manmade creation,but doubtsthat journalists will be keento take their work to the public",2
1,This is not a small capitulation,0
0,"In the 19th century, the textual criticism of German scholars revealedthat the supposed word of God in the Bible was a mess of competing stories",2
1,It did as much damage to Christianity and Judaism as Darwinism,0
1,Anyone hopingto repeat the exercise bytaking apart the Koran and the hadiths todaywill be restrained by the fearthat they will end upas dead as satiristswho tryto do the same with anti-clerical humour,0
0,My friend and comrade Maajid Nawaz was a jihadi,2
0,beforehe converted to liberalism and understands the totalitarian mind,2
5,He saysthat people still do not realisethat radical Islamists do not just wantto impose their taboos at gunpoint,2
1,"They wantto ""create a civil war""so that European Muslims acceptthat they can only live in the caliphate",0
5,to encourage the rise of the white far-rightso that ordinary coexistence becomes impossible,2
1,they win one demand,0
1,"asthey are winning in Britain,then they will up the tension and move to another",0
1,"As soon asyou look at demands rather than labels,the wall dividing extremists from the rest beginsto crumble",0
1,Saudi Arabia is Britain's trusted partner and ally,0
1,It receives vast quantities of armaments and in turn pumps propaganda into British mosques and universities,0
0,"AsParis looked like a war zone,it flogged the Saudi liberal Raif Badawi for insulting Islam",2
1,"At least they did not kill him,you might say",0
1,the religious courts had foundhim guilty of apostasy,0
1,"- that is, oftaking the adult decisionto abandon the religion of his childhood- the sentence would have been death",0
1,"European liberals oughtto have stopped,asthe lash fell on Badawi's shoulders, and wondered about their queasiness atcriticising the religions of the ""powerless""and ""marginalised""",0
1,The Saudi Arabian monarchy is all too powerful,0
1,are the other dictatorships of the Middle East,0
1,Power depends onwhereyou standandwho stands below you,0
1,The unemployed man with the gun is more powerful than the Parisian journalist,0
1,The marginal cleric may have a hard life,0
1,he sits in a sharia court imposing misogynist rules on British Muslim women,0
1,he isto be feared,0
1,"European liberals might tryto be true to their principles and ally with dissidents, liberals, leftists and free thinkers within Muslim communities",0
1,They might help ex-Muslimswho fearthat one day they will be murdered for apostasy,0
1,They might reflectthat a Muslim man will encounter xenophobia from the right,0
1,"they will hear no rigorous criticism at university or other leftist institutions of the sexism, anti-semitism, homophobia and bloodlust of militant religion",0
1,Self-interest oughtto be a motivator,0
1,"Fear of radical Islam is not only driving support for the National Front in France and Ukip here,butproviding an excuse for more attacks on civil liberties, including, despite David Cameron's pious words after Charlie Hebdo, attacks on freedom of speech",0
1,I hopeI am wrong,0
1,I cannot see a culture shift on this necessary scale happening,0
1,I fearwe must look forward to a lying and frightened future,0

1,bitter winter conditions set in,0
1,millions of refugees are in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance,0
1,The presence of thousands of foreign terrorist fighters there and in Iraq has added a further volatile dimension,0
1,Groups responsible for atrocities have capitalised on a legacy of atrocious governance towards disenfranchised populations,0
1,"Our response to brutality and extremism cannot be limited to military action,importantasit is",0
1,We must address the conditionsthat give rise to such poison in the first place,0
1,"In the same vein, those conducting military actions against terrorists must be surethat such efforts fully observe human rights",0
1,Aswe have seen time and again,0
1,failureto do socan end upserving as a recruiting agent for terrorists,0
1,"Elsewhere, the recent appalling terrorist attacks in Paris showhow vulnerableany society can be",0
1,Countries in Europe and elsewhere have witnessed a deeply worrying escalation of tensions between communities and within societies,0

2,Mahan in Madhya Pradesh is one of the oldest and largest sal forests in Asia,2
1,The local communities are dependent on the forest for their livelihoods,0
1,it is also home to several rare and endangered species,0
0,"But a portion of this reserve is earmarked for open cast coal mining by Essar, a British company registered in London",2
1,"In order to mine for coal, they would needto cut down the forest and displace thosewho live there",0
4,"Essar would destroy more than 1,000 hectares of pristine forests and the biodiversitythat it supports,affecting 54 villages",2
1,"It would also impact on the livelihoods of thousands morewho depend on forest produce,and the wildlife, water and air in the region",0
0,"For the last three years I have been helping villagers in Mahanto assert their rights, protect their forest, and prevent the open-cast coalmine development",2
0,"Unfortunately, during this time, I have experienced a wide range of intimidation tactics",2
0,I have received anonymous phone callsthreatening violenceand been followed by a car without a number plateasI travelled to village meetings,2
0,Last year I discoveredthat a forged letter bearing my signature had been given to local media,2

0,I was not allowedto board my flight despitehaving valid travel documents,2
0,"My passport was stamped with ""offloaded"" at the airport",2
0,I was askedto go home,2
0,The only explanation offered wasthat this was being done by the orders of the government of India,2
0,"Since then, I have consulted lawyers and written to government agencies",2
0,I've had no official response,2
1,"some newspapers reportedthat I have been put on a ""blacklist"" or ""lookout list""preventing me fromleaving the country",0
1,Such lists are usually for those with criminal convictions,0
0,I don't have one,2
1,"Refusing my travelto speak to British MPs with no legal reasonto do sois an infringement on my fundamental rights, and a shocking blow to the strength and freedom of civil society in India",0
1,My travel was legitimate,0
2,Essar is based in London,2
0,I was invited by a British all-party parliamentary groupto talk about my work and to present the social and environmental impacts of the project - otherwise known as freedom of speech,2
1,We are equally engaged with all major parties and relevant politicians and administrators in India on this issue,0
1,The fight in Mahan is about the rights of those peoplewho live there and depend on the forest for their livelihoods,0
1,The local community is only askingthat due process is followed,0
2,under Indian law there must be a local referendum and consent from the local community,2
1,these laws have been bypassed,0
1,"now the government is reviewing major environmental laws, including the Forest Rights Act,that have been key inprotecting forest dwellers",0
1,This iswhya fight such as Mahan in India is critical,0
1,"It's symptomatic ofhowIndia will actwhenit comes tomaking important decisions about forests, conservation, community rights and a sustainable way of development",0
2,The act ofengaging all relevant stakeholdersis part of my work as a Greenpeace member and indeed the responsibility of any vibrant civil society in any functional democracy,2
1,"Travelling to Londonto meet British MPswas neither an attack on the Indian government, nor a violation of the laws of our country",0
1,"Internationally, India is under a lot of pressureto make strong commitments totackling climate change",0
1,it is drawn to the cheap and immediate gains of coal despite the high social and environmental cost,0
1,Groups such as Greenpeace are a vital check on the power of corporations and politicians,0

1,"With the annual Ucas university application deadline looming on Thursday, thousands of 17-year-olds will be putting the finishing touches to their personal statements",0
1,"And so another cycle of conditional offers, A-level results and nervous forays into freshers' week begins",0
1,"Unlike 50 years ago,whena tiny, socially elite proportion went to university",0
1,"they will be joining almost 50% of their peers instudying for a degree, facing average costs of upwards of?46k for a three-year degree, including tuition and living costs, compared with the generous grants available up until the 1990s",0
1,"Setting expansion aside,it is remarkablehow muchhasn't changed: at the heart of the systemremains a core model of young people moving away to universityto study for three-year full-time degrees",0
1,for which they now bear much of the coststhemselves,0
1,Yet the jobs market has changed beyond recognition,0
1,Graduates are now responsible forforging their own careers in a fluid market compared with the jobs for lifethat were the norm a few decades ago,0
1,employers are demanding a completely different set of skills,0
1,"Does this model, then,remain fit for purpose?",0
1,"The political debate has focused on fee levels and headline prices to the exclusion of almost everything else, including the benefits and value of a university education - andhowthey might be improved",0
1,The debate aboutwhetherthe 50% participation target is too highhas been similarly staid,0
1,surely it's a no-brainerto hopethat at least half of young people engage in advanced learning,0
1,But what type of learningshould that be?,0
1,One of the purported benefits ofmarketising higher educationwasthat the market itself would deliver innovation and better value,0
1,But the government massively overegged the potential for higher educationto behave like a market,0
1,Student demand far exceedssupply of places and price has become a proxy for quality,0
1,"Little wonder, then,that average fees are far higher than the?6,000 a yearthat the then universities minister, David Willetts, predicted",0
1,"he introduced the?9,000 fee cap",0
1,We now have the nonsense of a marketwherestudents pay the same for very different amounts and quality of academic provision,0
1,This is reflected in the variation in students' own perceptions,0
4,research by the consumer body Which?found almost a third of first-year undergraduatesthoughttheir course was poor value for money,2
4,less than half thought seminars were worthattending,2
1,There is too little accountability for this variation within the powerful sector,0
1,universities award their own degrees,0
1,the sector is opaque,0
1,even resisting movesto publish comparable information on the amount ofteachingstudents can expect for their fees,0
1,"the higher education regulator is weak, with virtually no powersto telluniversities to buck up standards",0
1,The debate about innovation has centred on distance learning and Moocs (Massive Online Open Courses),0
1,There is no doubtdevelopments in technology have the potentialto transformthe way university education is experienced,0
1,But it's pointlessto focus on technology at the expense of changesthat needto happen in the systemin orderto take advantage of it,0
1,Moocs will not transform the sectoruntilthey are embraced by the most prestigious universities,0
1,"whyshouldn't you be ableto study for a cut-price Oxford degree, half via YouTube and Skype, and half among the dreaming spires?",0
1,Other innovationsthat could bring down costs withoutsacrificing qualitymight be a restructure of the systemto standardise first-year curriculums,0
1,enabling young peopleto combinestudying for a year or two at their local university with a year or two on campus at a more specialist institution,0
1,"We could see more professional degrees co-delivered and funded by universities and employers, such as the accountancy degree offered by Durham and KPMG",0
1,in which young people benefit from six years of combined university and work experience,0
1,"Or there could be more intensive two-year courses, perhaps aimed at young peoplegetting a year or two of work experience after school",0
1,University could be combined with more modern ways ofadjustingto adulthood,0
1,"for example, a year spent in a structured volunteering programme, such as that offered by the charity City Year, offers huge opportunitiesto develop the grit and teamwork so valued by today's employers",0
1,whilemaking a real contribution to schools and other public services,0
1,"But on some measures we are movingbackwards, with a massive fall in numbers of part-time and mature students in the few yearssince the ?9,000 fee cap was introduced",0
1,There are lessons from the 1960s,0
0,"Harold Wilson's government realisedthat the only wayto increase access in the face of a reluctant sectorwasto back Michael Young's vision for a new institution, the Open University",2
4,which increased the student population by Britain by a fifth,2

1,Of course there will always be a role for the academic,0
1,"But should we be shoehorning the majority of undergraduates into this model, orshouldgettinga degree more routinely encompass work experience?",0
1,It should also introduce strong new accountabilities within the sector,0
1,"One way ofdoing thiswould beto separate degree-awarding powers fromlearning provision,assuggested by the Social Market Foundation",0
1,"This would allow new providersto offer innovative ways ofmeeting the standards set by a Russell Group university, for example",0
1,And government should provide more incentives for universitiesto innovate,0

1,"No matterhow muchanyone prayedthat the Ched Evans ""debate"" had completed its race to the bottom this week,it was never goingto have doneso untilwe'd heard in full from Gordon Taylor",0
1,That pleasure was always in the post,0

5,"""Hewouldn't be the first personto be foundguilty,maintained his innocence, and been proved right,""Taylor opined to the BBC",2

1,"Reputedto be the highest paid union official in the world, and onewho has been in his job for just the 33 years",0
5,"Taylor has now saidhe didn't mean""to upset anybody""",2
1,thoughI need hardly addthat he has no plansto consider his position after his latest display of incompetence,0
3,"In which case, I hopehe'll forgive myconsidering it for him - an actthat has become as essential an annual event for me asputting up the Christmas treeor rewatching the early work of Steven Seagal",1
1,Taylor's presence is dramatically revealed as the second-highest-profile instance of affirmative action for idiots in public life,0
1,it hardly needspointing outagain that Gordon is no longer fit for purpose,0
1,indeedhe ever was,0
3,But more on his record shortly,1
1,That Taylor should have rifled through his Rolodex of metaphors and alighted on the absolute archetype of victim-blamingin orderto continue obliquely victim-blaming in the Ched Evans case,0
1,"well, perhaps there's a mirthless laughto be had there",0
1,But it would take a stronger stomach than mineto manage it,0
1,"The sadness - or rather, one of many acute and diverse sadnesses - isthat this was a weekin which football was crying out for an intelligent and sensitive advocate,findingitself once more cast in a roleit should never be requiredto occupy in a truly civilised society",0
1,All manner of people appeared convincedthat the game should mitigate the deficiencies of the criminal justice system,0
1,just asa worrying number were keento sayEvans was absolutely welcometo work again -flipping burgers or sweeping the streets,0
1,These are the jobsthat are fit for rapists,0

1,that seems to you like a view of society worth shoring up,0
1,the week will have feltdistinctly encouraging,0
1,"As for football fans - the great ""them"" of many debates - they have spent the weekbeing cast as too thick and impressionableto be ableto make their own judgments about a convicted rapist",0
1,"Evans could have been nothing but a role model, presumably to the vast tumultwho turn out at Boundary Park each week",0
1,It's as depressingasit is disturbing,0
1,Such toxicity and lunacy have attached themselves to football and its place in our society,0
1,"that thosewho love the sport as well as thosewho playit really need the calm, cool intellect and charm of a Shami Chakrabartito lobby in their real interests and those of the game",0
1, they have Gordon Taylor,0

5,"""Peterdoesn't knowwhatwe've done for Paul,""he announced to the Press Association,""a lot of which hasto be confidential.""",2
1,It certainly does,0
1,Except Gordon just couldn't bringhimself to keepit that way,0
0,The next few days were spent with this union leader giving detailed interviews on Gascoigne's mental state and past treatment,2
0,"in which he divulged telephone calls with the player, made off-the-cuff pseudo-clinical diagnoses, and - unbelievably - used the union's own websiteto warn",2
1,we're not careful,0
5,"it is goingto be akin to George Best.""",2
1,"Then again, Taylor had form with sharing details of members' treatment,having done the same with Joey Barton only a few months previously",0
3,"Anyway, on we go",1
0,"In 2013 came the revelationthat Taylor had amasseda?100,000 debt to a bookmaker - almost an inevitability to thosewho recalledhim pontificating about a ""zero tolerance"" approach tobetting among players just a couple of years before",2
1,And no round-up of Gordon's greatest hits would be complete without a look at that endlessly intriguing confidentiality dealhe signed with News International,0
0,"which awarded him a?700,000 settlement for phone-hacking in return for his silence",2
5,"Asthe News of the World's lawyers later had it in a letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee,Taylor's lawyers had informed themthat he ""wantedto be vindicated or maderich""",2
1,"that he reportedly earns?984,000 a year (maybe more these days)",0
1,you might judgehim to be rich already,0
1," we knowwhich option won out, a dealthat precluded Taylor frombreathing a word about phone-hacking to any of his union's members",0
1,who he might reasonably have concludedcould have been victims themselves,0
1,Asthey were eventuallyproved(by others) to have been,0
1,So there you have him: the pastoral carerwho reveals details of his members' mental health in the noble cause of self-defence,0
1,The gamblerwho wishesto outlaw gamblers,0
1,"The ur-phone-hacking plaintiffwho agreedto take the?700,000 and say absolutely nothing about the matter, despitebeing responsible for players",0

1,"And now he is the victim-blamer's victim-blamer, in a weekwhere,you might have hazarded,even Katie Hopkins couldn't have contrivedto makea grim situation worse",0
1, experience would indicatethat Taylor ignores his detractors at the very opposite of his peril,0
1,"So allthat remainsisforme to take the early opportunityto apologise for next year's inevitable appearance of this column, and bid Mr Taylor a cordial au revoir",0
0,"Five years ago, I went on a searchto answer the question:Whatcan people doto have a happy, fulfilling, lifelong marriage?",2
1,"I sought out an unusual source of information, however",0
0,I didn't ask psychologists or consult self-help gurus,2
0," I decidedto go to the people with the most experience: older Americanswho have been married 50, 60, 70 years and more(described in my recent book, ""30 Lessons for Loving"" (Hudson Street Press, January 8, 2015)",2
1,I believedthat the view from the finish line of marriage would be uniquely valuable,0
0,I wasn't disappointed,2
1,"America's elders provided a treasure trove of lessons, tips, and advice forhowto find the right mate and keepthe spark alive over decades",0
1,Here are seven thingsthey would like younger peopleto know,0
3,"who are looking for a relationships to thosewho are in oneand strivingto make it last ""as longasyou both shall live.""",1
1,Marriage is hard,0
1,Even thoughthis is not onthe minds of couples gettingengagedor standing at the altar,0
1,the elders wantyou to knowthat marriage is hard,0
1,It's tough - both because of the range of stresses and problemsthat confront all couples,0
1,but also because of the fundamental difficulty ofmerging two separate and different people into one single life,0
0,"I learnedthat they see marriage as a discipline, likebecoming an athlete or a musician",2
1,you never reach perfection,0
1,you are constantly learning,0
1,you sacrifice short-term gain for something more rewarding later on,0
1,But marriage for a lifetime is worth it,0
5,"Being with someone for a half century or more,they told me,is incredibly good",2
1,"It is a sublime experience, a connection to another person unlike any other relationship",0
5,The elders describe it as the experience of a lifetime,2
1,"For peoplewho make it,it even beats the heart-pounding passion offalling in love for the first time",0
1,So making a marriage lastmay be hard,0
1,the elders also wantyoung people to knowthat it's worth the effort,0
1,Whatcan you doto keepthe spark aliveandthe marriage interesting for decades?,0
0,The elders adviseyou to think small,2
1,The view from the end tells youthat a marriage is made up of hundreds of daily interactions,0
1,"In each of those you have a chanceto be positive,to be cheerful,to be supportive",0
1,"They suggestthat you make a habit ofdoing small, positive things",0
0,One ideathat came up oftenis doing your partner's chore,2
1,"Sayit's 6 AM on a cold, rainy morning,the dog is scratching on the bedroom door,andit's your partner's turnto walk him- butyou get up and do it",0
1,That's money in the bank for the relationship,0
1,"Talk, Talk, Talk",0
0,The elders believethat many marital problems can be solved through open communication,2
5,"One manput it colorfully:""Keep yapping at one another.""",2
1,"According to the elders, the strong, silent type may be initially attractive - but probably doesn't make the best marriage partner",0
5,"As one 80-something told me:""Ifyou can't communicate,you're just two dead ducks.""",2
1,Stop tryingto change your partner,0
1,you are getting serious about someone,0
5,",the elders sayyou must accept your partnerasis,or don't get married",2
1,"You should never say to yourself:""Afterwe're married,she or he will loseweight/get a job/like my family/change heart abouthaving kids""-or any other behavior or attitudeyou don't like",0
1," ask yourself:""Can I live with this trait for a lifetime",0
1,makingyour partner a do-it-yourself projectonly leads to anger and disappointment,0
1,Are we hungry?,0
0,Here's onethat surprised me,2
1,a couple is having an argumentthat threatensto become a truly major blow-up,0
0,the elders suggestthat whatyou may needis - a sandwich,2
0,these long-married folks saythat you should never argue on an empty stomach,2
1,Offer your partner somethingto eatwhenhe or she is aboutto fly off the handle,0
1,"According to the elders, rather than a therapist you may sometimes need a pastrami sandwich or a piece of pie",0
1,It's cheaper and more fun!,0
1,you want more wisdom ,0
1,"ask the elders in your own lifewhatMaybe it's inevitable,now that Julian Assange,has spent almost 1,500 days in the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy,that memories ofhowhe cameto be in theregrow ever more hazy",0
1,"With a forgetfulnessthat,ifgenuine,demonstrateshowrapidly the most preposterous inventions can acquire the status of fact",0
1,even his colleagues at WikiLeaks have convinced themselvesthat Assange was incarcerated by a British government determinedto keephim quiet,0
5,"Among the more opportunistic tweets responding to the massacre in Paris,came this,from the WikiLeaks account:""David Cameron pontificates about freedom of speechwhilespending millions detaining #Assange without trial.""",2
1,"At this impressive rate of fabulation, the 2,000th day should see our unhappy visionary gagged in a dripping cell",0
1,he awaits the death sentence applied to all fugitiveswho dare speak freely in the Kafkaesque nightmarethat is 21st- century Britain,0
1,"It would bear as much relation to the facts, after all, as the current myth of his forced detention without trial",0
0,"in June 2012, Assange, founder of WikiLeaks,was in the UK, freeto speak on any subjecthe liked,andfighting extradition from Britain to Sweden,wherehe faced allegations of sexual assaults on two women",2
0,Preferringto break his bail conditions rather than clear his name in Swedenhe sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy,2
0,wherehe remains to this day,2
1,"It is a source of consternation,at least outside his support base,that the cost ofpolicing the embassyso asto enforce the legal processshould Assange everemerge,has now exceeded?9m",0
0,"Last November, an arrest warrant for Assange was upheld in a Swedish court",2
1," #Assange is not ""detained"" by anyone or anything other than his own reluctanceto facequestioning about alleged sex offences, in a countrywhereextradition to the US is no more likelythanit is here",0
1,"But maybe this confusion about his journey from free-speech celebrity to pallid hermit helpsone understandwhyAssange, though accused of sex offences, has survived much of the public opprobrium, internet gossip and suspicionthat dogs other individuals associated with accusations of sexual misconduct, such as the harassment expert Julien Blanc or the Lib Dem octopus, Lord Rennard",0
0,"On the websitewherea petition denounces the footballer and convicted rapist Ched Evans,thousands demand the Nobel prize, along with freedom and protection, for Assange",2
0,"his admirers even attemptedto kickstart funds for a statue,honouring the manwho has portrayed his Swedish accusers as instruments in a smear campaign",2
1,"Other analysts, however, have detected enough evidence of female self-determinationto attribute the women's hostility to everything from sexual jealousy to a bad case of radical feminism",0
1,"Clearly, Assange's better-informed supporters,who include celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Arundhati Roy and Vivienne Westwood,will be aware of the Swedish allegations and have chosen, for one reason or another,to set them aside",0
1,"A similar immunity seemsto have been conferred on Prince Andrew, following allegations of his sexual improprietywith a minorwho worked for his American friend, a convicted paedophile",0
0,"Though""emphatically denied"",with the extra benefit of a character reference from Andrew's ex-wife,who was lent money by the paedophile",2
0,there has been no announcement of the type of legal manoeuvrethat the similarly accusedAlan Dershowitz is pursuing after allegationsthat he also took sexual advantage of the 17-year-old,2
5,"Yet Andrew, too, has so far escaped a petition objecting to him ""assisting the economic success of our United Kingdom"",asthe palace describes his various holidays",2
1,"Perhaps,ashappened to the creepy Blancwhenhe attemptedto visit the UK,some other country would be good enoughto help out with a banning order",0
1,"the difference between unproven allegations and, in Ched Evans's case, a formal conviction, can satisfactorily explain this variability in public tolerance",0
1,"the footballer's supporters are surely entitledto compare his treatment unfavourably with, for example, that of Roman Polanski",0
1,"Whyhave opponents of Evans's return to football, now or ever, not shown similar concern about the film director's rehabilitation?",0
0,"Polanski's return to Poland, forfilming,has just prompted another US extradition request,that he be returnedto face sentencing pending since 1978",2
0,whenhe admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old,2
1,"It must help, of course,that successful film directors have not been classified, by whichever national committee rules on fitness for role- modelling, as officially inspirational",0
1,"Polanski, like his colleague Woody Allen,who embarked, in his mid-50s, on an affair with his partner's 19-year- old daughter, sister to three of his children,cannot be accused of betraying impressionable fans, those millions of starstruck kiddies",0
1,whose wee moral compasses are leftspinning wildlywhentheir idols fall short,0
1,"That responsibility is still monopolised,asrepeatedly confirmed in ongoing Evans analysis, by the professionthat is, for many of us, more strongly associated than any other - no disrespect to full-time pimps or Sun newspaper editors- with vulgarity, aggression, racism, irresponsibility and contempt for women",0
1,"The Professional Footballers' Association's Gordon Taylor's casual analogy between the plight of Evans, the convicted rapist,andthat of the bereaved Hillsborough families only confirmsthat the professionthat gave us Rooney's ""auld slapper"", Sky Sport's""didyou smash it"",and, yet more recently,the Premier League Richard Scudamore's ""big-titted broads"" work-account remains institutionally unworthy of redemption, at leastwherewomen are concerned",0
1,"Maybe it is not irrationally high expectations of football's young ambassadors, so much as an evidence-based recoil from its culture,that has fuelled a special implacability towards Ched Evans, to the point ofclosing down his career",0
1,"His only hope of eventual re-employment in football, at this point, is not,surely, his future father-in-law's website, but either a) an open letter from Naomi Wolf, feminist and champion of Julian Assange, or b) an appearance by Whoopi Goldberg protestingthat Evans's was not ""rape-rape""",0
0,"Polanski also benefited from extensive celebrity support, including,whenhe was arrested in Switzerland in 2009,a petition for his release signed by, among the British luminaries, Salman Rushdie, Sam Mendes, Stephen Frears, Terry Gilliam, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson and Tilda Swinton",2
5,"Everyone in international film-making,they said,wantedPolanksi ""to knowthat he has their support and friendship""",2
1,Perhaps there should be one law for acclaimed intellectuals and another for men such as Ched Evans?,0
1,"ifnot, the latter must have at least as good a case as Polanski for re-employment",0
1,once he has completed his sentence,0
1,a serious sex conviction should cost a footballer his entire career,0
1,"then a similar vigilance should, surely, be applied to discernible sleazebaggery in any other profession, fromwhistleblowing to royal work,whereclemency might be mistaken for approval",0

1,"""bae"" only made its way to mainstream parlance in the last few years",0
1,it is a wordthat most black folk have been intimately familiar with for decades,0
1,Its etymology was unclear,0
1,its meanings and nuances are deeply understood in context,0
0,"""What'sup, bae?""""That'smy bae,""etc ,have been ways ofstaking claim and announcing intimacy between oneselfand one's (sometimes prospective) lover",2
0,"Bae is also used as a term of endearment and affection for someone withwhom there is no romantic involvement or interest (not unlike ""honey"" or ""sweetheart""is used in Southern dialogue),as in ""Hey bae, canyou passme that plate?""",2
0,"And then Pharrell put it in a song,Miley Cyrus did a cameo,andit gained the attention of mainstream media",2
0,"Suddenly there were articles attemptingto definethe word ""bae""",2
0,"otherwise reputable businesses beganimplementing ""bae"" in their social media ad campaigns",2
1,everybody and they mama startedusing it,0
1,At which point it was declared overused by organs of upper-class white folk media like Time magazine,0
1,Fair enough: white people's adoption of the term distorted it to the point of misuse and meaninglessness,0
1,"Whatwas once a word born of the beautifully eclectic black Southern laziness of the tongue and a shortened version of baby,became a catchall term for anything from inanimate objects to food",0
1,The reference to affection was consistent,0
1,bae was usedto describe everything from one's (desired or actual) significant other to pancakes,0
0,"""That's bae"",a student swooned,glancing at a picture of J Cole during a discussion of black masculinity last summer in class",2
0,"""These cupcakes are bae"",I read in a Facebook post attached to a picture of a delicious-looking dessert not many months later",2
1,"And just like that,the shelf life of bae in the public imagination expired",0
1,the gatekeepers of mainstream language decidedthat it must be banned,0
1,"Cultural appropriation at its best, steals, reduces, overuses and then disposes of words like so much bathwater",0
5,"The linguist Jane H Hill defines language appropriation as ""a type of complex cultural borrowingthat involves a dominant group's 'theft' of aspects of a target group's language.""",2
5,Hill claimsthat the 'theft' adds value to white identitywhilefurther marginalizing nondominant groups,2
1,"This cultural ""borrowing"" of black language and phraseology happens regularly,allowing non-black folkto ""try on"" black culture through the use of African American English vernacular and slang withouthavingto ""put on"" the cultural consequences ofactually being black in a culture conditionedto devalue and dismiss it",0
5,"As Hill claims, language appropriation is further problematicbecauseit gives dominant groups control over the language",2
1,"Dominant groups getto decide, for example,when and ifcertain words are worth appropriation",0
1,when and howthe words should be used,0
1,"and thenwhenthe word becomes cliche, overused and therefore passe",0
1,"And often in the process,ashappened with ""bae"",the dominant group ends upchanging the meaning or pronunciation of words entirely",0
1,The good news isthat black language is resilient,0
1,black folk are creative,0
1,"even whenthe dominant culture triesto dispose of the termsit wears out,other words and phrases will emerge",0
1,We already know some of them,0
0,"Already you can see terms grounded in communities (""bye Felicia""), disguised in pronunciation (""ratchet""), or invented from imagination (""on fleek"")slipping into mainstream and popular culture lexicons (again)",2
1,"There, they will be massproduced for financial gain (again),andeventually disposed of (again)",0
1,"So, whathappenswhenmainstream culture decidesto dispose of a word stolen from black language and then used to the point of saturation in popular culture?",0
1,The word may lose its noveltyso that thosewho appropriated itstopsaying or using it,0
1,the word won't disappear or lose its utility in the black community,0
1,We will go onsaying bae,0
1,"We will say it to our lovers in casual moments at home, and to our childrento be endearing",0
1,"We will say it in the grocery store, at the movie theatre and across church pews on Sunday mornings as a substitute for names",0
1,"We will say it to each other -aswe have always done- lovingly, reverently and mindfully",0
1,"And with any luck, the word will settle back into its original meaning, sans the unsolicited remix of dominant white culture",0
1,Israel is recruiting,0
0,"With the individual and collective trauma of the Paris attacks still fresh, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not lose any time and appealed to the French Jewsto leave their home country behind and to emigrate to Israel",2
1,"Whileunity was on parade in Paris,Netanyahu brought with him discord and old rifts",0
1,"The brazenness of his suggestion, uttered in front of French President Francois Hollande, is unrivalled",0
1,"Asis the political opportunism,exploiting a recent tragedy for the purpose ofboosting European emigration to a countrybuilt on the expulsion and discrimination of the Palestinian population",0
1,"Such cunning, moreover, falls in line with the staple self-legitimation of Israel through mentions of a less recent disaster, namely the shoah",0
1,"Zionist ideology dismisses diplomatic protocol and brushes aside any considerations for the human rights of the Palestinian people, all in light of the absolute rightthat the Israelis purportedly derive from deadly massacres",0
1,"Perversely, Israel depends upon, lives off, and grows stronger thanks to these tragedies; both past and present",0
1,"In this sense, it repeats and amplifies the brutalities of these events",0
1,"The disturbing conclusion,to which we are led by the persistent behaviour of Israeli politicians and by the country's official discourse,isthat the State of Israel is symbiotically tied to the atrocitiesthat preceded its establishmentandthat continue to this day",0
1,"I doubtthat either Netanyahu, or members of his inner circle even realise the full extent of the cynicism inusing the murder of French Jews in a kosher supermarket forfurthering ideological aims",0
1,"To them, the tactic does not appear extraordinary at all",0
1,"becauseit has been honed, in one form or another, for decades",0
1,So much sothat Israel may be saidto have styled itself as a political phoenix,0
0,"The phoenix is a mythical birdthat, uponburning up,regenerates from the ashes",2
0,"In my book, Pyropolitics:Whenthe World Is Ablaze,I discussedthe dangers inherent in the political version of the phoenix myth",2
1,"On January 11, 2015, we sawthe spectacle replayed in Paris, albeit not in reference to Auschwitz, but with regard to the latest outbursts of anti-Jewish violence",0
0,"The manipulation of fear and insecurity, experienced by French Jews, reached a high pitch not only in Netanyahu's words but also in a workshop onhowto immigrate to Israel,held in Paris on the day of the unity march",2
0,Attended by no more than 500 people in a countrythat is home to half-a-million Jews,2
1,"the ""aliyah fair"" represented yet another effortto put terrorist actions to political use in favour of Israel",0
1,"asconservatives claim,fascism and ""Islamic extremism"" have something in common",0
1,it ishowthey are utilised by Israelto augment its Jewish population at the expense of the diaspora,0
1," it does not occur to the Israeli political elitethat, absent a comprehensive peace with the neighbouring Palestinian state, European Jews will not find the securitythey are promised in the eastern corner of the Mediterranean",0
1,"Perpetually at war and on edge,Israel does not come out favourably in comparison with France - even with a France rattled by a series of terrorist attacks",0
1,"no alternative parades, like Netanyahu's one-man reverse crusades, will change that",0
0,"In the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris last week, many people in France and elsewhere have declared, Je suis Charlie",2
0,"afterheavily armed gunmen broke into the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French magazine, and killed eight staff members, two police officers, a building maintenance worker and wounded several others",2
0,"On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people including a number of world leaders such as Angela Merkel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and David Cameron gathered in Paris for a unity rally,to stand in mourning, in defiance",2
0,"There were cries of Je suis Charlie, Je suis Ahmed(I am Ahmed, the Muslim police officerwho lost his life in the attack),Je suis juif(I am a Jew)",2
1,These declarations were a display of solidarity with thosewho lost their livesand thosewho survived,0
1,They allowed peopleto try and place themselves in the lives of othersbyusing the power of language,0
1,We have seen this kind of remembrance before in the face of tragedy,0
0,I am Troy Davis,2
0,I am Mike Brown,2
0,I am Eric Garner,2
0,I am Renisha McBride,2
2,But we are none of these people,2
1,"We can and do empathize with the plights of the dead, the survivors and their loved ones",0
1,"We can and do empathize withhow fragilewe all are,and withhowwe cannot be ruled by terror, but",0
1,whythe rhetorical urgeto take the place of the fallen?,0
1,Whatdoes it bring them?,0
1,"I, too, have ached sincehearing the news ofwhathappened in Paris but je ne suis pas Charlie et je ne suis pas Ahmed et je nesuis pas juif",0
1,"There are timeswhensilence equals consent, but is the loss of someone else's life really such an instance?",0
1,"Is it reasonableto assumethat ifje ne suis pas Charlie,I tacitly endorse terrorism?",0
1,"I believe in the freedom of expression, unequivocally",0
1,I wishmore people would understandthat freedom of expression is not freedom from consequence,0
0,I findsome of the work of Charlie Hebdo distasteful,2
1,becausethere is a preponderance of bigotry of all kinds in many of their cartoons' sentiments,0
1, my distaste should not dictate the workthe magazine producesoranything else,0
1,The cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo - and writers and artists everywhere - should be ableto express themselves and challenge authority withoutbeing murdered,0
1,Murder is not an acceptable consequence for anything,0
1,"Yet it is also an exercise of freedom of expressionto express offense at the way satire like Charlie Hebdo's characterizes somethingyou hold dear - like your faith, your personhood, your gender, your sexuality, your race or ethnicity",0
1,Demands for solidarity can quickly turn into demands for groupthink,0
1,makingit difficultto express nuance,0
1,It puts the terms of our understanding of the situation in black and white,0
1,you are either with us or against us - instead ofallowing peopleto mourn and be angrywhilealso being sympathetic to complexitiesthat are being overlooked,0
1,It has been dishearteningto see calls for the Muslim communityto denounce terrorism,0
1,"It has been dishearteningto see journalists highlighting the stories of ""good"" Muslims",0
1,goodness is the exception to the rule of an entire people,0
1,"We will continueto see discussions of satire, the freedom of expression and its limits",0
1,We will see speculations as tohowsuch a tragedy can be avoided,0
1,becauseit is easierto speculatethanit isto acceptthat we cannot prevent terrorism,0
1,We cannot sway extremists with rational thought or with our ideas of right and wrong,0
1,Life moves quickly,0
1,"sometimes, consideration does not",0
1," we insistthat people provide an immediate response, or immediate agreement, a universal, immediate me-too ",0
1,"as thoughwe don't want people to pause at all,to considerwhatthey are weighing in on",0
1,We don't wantto complicate our sorrow or outrage,0
1,"it is easierto experience these emotions in their simplest, purest states",0
1,"The older(andhopefully wiser)I get,the more I want to pause",0
1,I wantto take the timeto think throughhowI feelandwhyI feel,0
1,I don't wantto feign expertise on mattersI know nothing about for the purpose ofoffering someone else my immediate reaction for their consumption,0
1,"The demand for response from all of us through the means available to us, most often our social networks, rises in partbecausewe can feel so impotent in our day-to-day lives",0
1,We are people with jobs and families and our quotidian concerns,0
1,It is easyto feel impotent in the face of terrorism in Paris or hundreds of girls being kidnapped in Nigeria or a bombing at an NAACP building in Colorado or an unarmed black man being killed by a police officer,0
1,"Within our social networks, we can feel less alone",0
1,We can feel less impotent,0
1,We can make these gestures of solidarity,0
1,Je suis Charlie,0
1,We can change our avatars,0
1,"We can share our anger, our fear, or devastation withouthavingto facethat we may not be ableto do much more",0
1,we still feel impotent,0
1,we still feel inadequate,0
1,Whenwe see peoplenot participating in our expressions of solidarity--not showing their awareness of their own impotence-- we see somethingwe can possibly change,0
1,That iswhywe demand allegiance,0
1,You would be forgiven forthinkingthat centuries of human society would meanthat we were now at a stagewherewe didn't need helpfinding another human beingwhom we could bearto be aroundandwho wantedto get naked with us,0
1,But you would be mistaken,0
1,It seemsastime progresseswe need more and more tactics fortricking someone into a relationship,0
1,Some people needpickup artists to helpthem manipulate women,0
1,"others think""science"" will provide the 21st-century love potion",0
0,"In the latest use of scientists' time, they have foundthat eating dessert on a date increases the likelihoodthat there'll be a second date",2
1,"This research is flawed on a number of levels, not leastbecauseyou shouldn't have a meal on a first date: too many food-related potential disastersand not enough alcohol",0
1,you're on a date with a diabetic,0
1,",you could be responsible forputting them into a coma",0
1,which is likelyto hamper the relationship,0
3, here are some further helpful dos and don'tswhenit comes todating,1
1,1) Don't callit dating imp,0
1,It's a horrible word and a horrible concept,0
1," think of it asgoing for a drink or to a gallery or whatever, and there being someone else there",0
1,This relieves the pressureto be attractiveand the crushing disappointmentthat comes with it,0
1,2) Do get drunk,0
1,There is no downside to this,0
1,"OK, there are a couple of downsides",0
1,"The trick isto get drunk enoughto be hilariously funny, intelligent and confident but not so drunkthat you lower your standards and impair your abilityto get the hell out of thereifit becomesboring or creepy",0
1,"you get so drunkthat you dance on a table, startcryingor vomit into your lap",0
1,you can always blame the booze,0
1,you don't drink,0
1,I'm afraidthere is nothingI can do for you,0
1,3) Don't be too self-deprecating,0
1,It is a good ideato showthat you don't take yourself too seriously,0
1,"it can be endearing, but keep it to the stories aboutgiving a presentation with your skirt/shirt tucked into your knickers/Y-frontsorwhenyou hada conversation about nobody taking you seriouslywhileyou had mustard on your face",0
1,Save the stories aboutwhenYou don't wantto waste these comedy gold stories on someoneyou might only see a couple of times,0
1,Whenyou don't wantto unload your A-list stories on someonewho might not be worthy,0
1,This is a journey of discovery,0
1,so temporarily hold some mystery back,0
1,4) Do find out their politics,0
2,Life is too shortto waste on someonewho thinksHitler had a point,2
1,It is goodto surround yourself with people with different views to your own,0
1,becausearguments are fun,0
2,everyone has their red-line issues,2
1,you might as well shake them down on thesebeforeyou spend too much on booze,0
1,"So tryto turn the conversation round to Ched Evans, free speech or the order of greatness of the Star Wars films",0
1,"(which forreference is: episode V, episode IV, Episode VI,episodes I-III don't exist and should never be mentioned)",0
1,you feelthey're wildly wrong on any of these subjects,0
1,shriekthat you've left the oven onand run,0
1,5) Don't talk about your ex(es) all night,0
1,You may liketo use every opportunityto talk about the profound personality flaws of your former lovers,0
1,it's rather ungallant and makesyou look slightly like a psychopath,0
1,You wantto hint at the factthat you have been in a relationship before,0
1,asit impliesthat there are human beingswho don't findyour regular presence completely loathsome,0
1,"make sureyou don't get a nervous tickwhenyou talk about itor startthese arewhatare known as ""giveaways""",0
1, we haveto be a little wary of claimsthat science holds the keyto love,0
1,asmany myths abound,0
1, pheromones don't work in humans,0
1,"Dopamine is releasedwhenyou're in loveandwhenyou eat chocolate,but alsowhenyou take cocaine and smoke fags",0
1,the latter two may very well hamper your success at relationships,0
4,Other research showsthat you increase your chances offalling in loveifyou ask just 36 questions and then stare into their eyes for four minutes,2
1,"Which looks a lot likejust showing an interest in someone and finding outyou have things in common, so not exactly rocket science",0
1,"In a short time, television debates have become a vital part of our democracy",0
4,They were watched by tens of millions of people in the 2010 general election campaign,2
1,the Scottish referendum campaign would have been poorer without the two showdowns between Alex SalmondandAlistair Darling live across all media platforms,0
1,Now is not the timeto retreat from the kind of broadcastingthat engages so many voters and illuminatesthe choicesthey face,0
1,"Naturally,I hope all the major parties take part in the 2015 election debates",0
1,That will rightly remain the aim of the broadcasters,0
1,I believethey should be resolute in the face of a refusal by one partyto take part,0
1,"the empty chair, or the deserted lectern, should be an option",0
0,The BBC guidelines do not specifically cover a national leaders' debate,2
1,the principlesthey set outargue not justthat they can wheel out the empty chair,0
1,that they should,0
5,"On general output, BBC publishededitorial policy isthat one reluctant participant cannot stop an item",2
5,"""The refusal of an individual or an organisationto make a contributionshould not be allowedto act as a veto on the appearance of other contributors.""",2
1,That is confirmed in the various election guidelines,0
1,over the years the ability of one awkward candidateto stop a broadcasthas been removed,0
1,"And the BBC and other broadcasters do use the empty chair, albeit on less high-profile occasions",0
1,a news maker is unwillingto face the cameras,0
1,best practice isto say so and to cover the topic anyway,0
0,"As far back as 1987,whenI was Today's political producer,we empty-chaired Labour in a campaign debate on defence - to the fury of their leadership",2
0,they had been given every opportunityto take partand had chosennot to,2
0,we went ahead with the other parties and told our listenerswhathad happened,2
1,There is in this current row a legitimate argument about fairness and aboutwho takes part,0
1,"The arid bureaucratic view would bethat this should be based on the results of the 2010 general election and therefore be a three-way debate between David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg",0
1,The rise of Ukip and the surge in multi-party politics have muddied the waters,0
1,the broadcasters are havingto be more flexible,0
1,I thinkthe Greens should be somewhere in the mix,0
1," I believewe can trust the BBC, ITV and Skyto come up with the right format and a proposalthat offers the appropriate levels of exposure to all the parties in the UK across the whole campaign",0
1,"It is for them,with the appropriate regulators, to make that judgment and not for individual politicians to seekto exclude or include their opponents",0
1,"It is, in any case, inevitablethat some debates of some kind will happen",0
1,The Farage v Clegg encounter just ahead of the European election campaign was an example of the asymmetrythat may now happen,0
1,it was not part of a formal coverage plan,0
1,it was compellingviewing for anyone interested in politics and millions of people tuned in,0
1,"The digital debate proposedby the Guardian, Telegraph and Google is one viable alternative",0
1,there is nothingto stop anyone hiring a hall in Manchester and getting Miliband and Cleggto debate there,0
1,I guaranteethe broadcasters would turn up,0
1,it is significantthat the opposition parties are willingto take part in debates even without the prime minister,0
1,"The broadcasters may, possibly, face a legal challenge about the allocation of national airtime",0
1,in the court of public opinion it would be a brave actto tryto close down a debatein which you have been invitedto take partbut have chosennot to,0
1,I'm pleasedto saythat I don't sensethe broadcasters are wavering,0
1,they are preparedto be tough,0
1,They are right,0
1,now is the timeto hold firm,0
1,"At a time of lack of faith in politicians, it would be the worst optionto allow game-playingto block a formatthat the public find valuable",0
1,Electors have a rightto see their potential prime ministers live and unfiltered and at length,0
1,Thosewho are willingto put themselves on the lineshould be allowedto do so,0
1,Thosewho don'tcan watch at home and seewhatan empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of primetime television,0
0,I was just one Australian face in a human sea of more than one and half million Parisians yesterday,2
0,I was tryingto comprehendwhatI was a part ofwhenthe placard thrust in front of my eyes madeit clear,2
1,"""La liberte d'expression n'a pas de religion""-freedom of expression has no religion",0
1,This was a rallyto defend the essential global human right to free expression,0
1,"A rightthat should not be bound by religious, cultural or political strictures",0
0,We were marchingto remember the victims of the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre and the Kosher grocery store siege,2

0,"And it'swhywe pausedto listenwhilea little African girl bellowed ""Je suis Charlie!""from a third story window at her mother's side",2
0,We were a calm sea of over 1.5 million people pouring through the grand boulevards of central Paris,2
0,"Led by the families of those killed and over 40 world leaderswho walked with linked arms,it was a significant moment in history, a moment triggered by outrage at the act of terroristswho massacred journalists and cartoonists in the middle of a weekly editorial meeting and ordinary citizensdoing their shopping",2
1,It was also a moment fuelled by a collective determinationto display unity and defiance in the face of terror and fear,0
1,"The attack on Charlie Hebdo and the climate of fear and anxietyit createdare, sadly, regular occurrences in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Pakistan and Mexico,wherejournalists are frequent targets",0
1,The western media too often turns a blind eye to the murder of journalists elsewhere,0
1,The Paris unity march represents a watershed moment in the struggleto protect journalists and defend freedom of expression globally,0
1,Kalashnikov-wielding terrorists took the fight into the heart of a newsroom in one of western Europe's biggest cities,0
1,that doesn't wake up complacent democracies to the needto vigorously defend the rightto report,0
1,nothing will,0
1,"Oncethe news cycle moves on from Paris and the cries of ""Je suis Charlie"" fade,we must harness the levels of public support and political willto enact significant and lasting change globally",0
1,We must be on guard against the already audible attemptsto justify a further curtailment of media and internet freedoms in the interests of national security in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks,0
1,"The threats posed to investigative journalism by mass surveillance, data retention and the criminalisation ofreporting certain information under anti-terrorism legislationare already significant",0
1,Especially in Australia,0
1,It would be an enormous tragedy,0
1,the lasting legacy of the Charlie Hebdo massacre was ultimately a further undermining of privacy and freedom of expression rights,0
1,Letus honour the victims and survivors of the Paris terrorist attacks byfinding a sustainable balance between the need for anti- terrorism measures against our collective human rightto freely express our views,0

5,"""Itshould not matterthat the investigation found no evidencethat Mr  Cochran had mistreated gays or lesbians,""the Times wrote",2
5,"""His position as a high-level public servant makes his remarks especially problematic, and requiresthat he be held to a different standard.""",2
5,"Robert White, executive director of the Georgia Baptist Convention, calledThe New York Times editorial ""quite remarkable.""",2
5,"""Itdeclares his innocence and then declareshim guilty,""he said",2
5,"""Guilty of what?He didn't discriminate against any homosexuals.He vowedthat he wantedto have a healthy work place for all of his employees.""",2
5,The Times went onto arguethat whileCochran is freeto believewhateverhe wants-there are limits towherehe can believe and still maintain gainful employment in the public arena,2
5,"""Ifhe wantsto work as a public official,however, he may not foist his religious views on other city employeeswho have the right to a bosswho does not speak of them as second-class citizens,""the Times wrote",2
5,"""Thereis a prejudice against Christians in this country right now,""White told me",2
0,Dr  White made his bold proclamationjust hours beforehundreds of Christians were expectedto gather at the Georgia capitolto protest the firing of Atlanta Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran,2
0,"Among those taking up his cause are the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, the Georgia Baptist Convention and the Family Research Council",2
5,"""Whathappened to Chief Cochrangoes to the core of religious freedom,""he said",2
5,"""Georgia Baptists are deeply concerned about the mistreatment of Kelvin Cochran.""",2
5,"Franklin Graham saidCochran was a target of ""politically correct bullying against Bible-believing Christians""and vowedto stand alongside the embattled former fire chief",2
5,"Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, saidthe Times had ""reached a new low in blatant hypocrisy.""",2
5,"""TheNew York Times is calling for public servantsto be held to a different standardwhenit comes to their freedom of speech and religion,""Perkins said",2
5,"""I thinkmost Americans are quite happy with the standardthat we have had for the last 226 years- the First Amendment.""",2
1,nothing else,0
1,Cochran's public shaming at the hands of Atlanta's mayor has unified Georgia Christians from all denominations and races,0
5,"""Thisis one of those thingsthat can bring people together from all of the political spectrum,""Garland Hunt, chairman of the Network of Politically Active Christians, told me",2
5,"""This is about religious freedom.This is not aboutwhethera person is conservative or liberal.""",2
1,The reality isthat a good man - a husband and father and grandfather - was fired from his jobbecausehis boss objected to his religious beliefs,0
1,That just oughtnot to happen in the United States,0
0,I'm reminded of somethingChief Cochran told me,2
5,"""TheLGBT members of our community have a rightto be ableto express their views and convictions about sexuality and deserveto be respected for their position without hate or discrimination,""he said",2
5,"""But Christians also have a rightto express our belief regarding our faith and be respected for our position without hate and without discrimination.In the United States, no one should be vilified, hated or discriminated against forexpressing their beliefs.""",2
1,"Maybe thosewho preachtolerance and diversity might wantto considerpracticing it,too",0
1,The attack on Charlie Hebdo compelsus to be clear and to be consistent,0
1,We haveto condemnwhathappened in Paris absolutely,0
0,I said the same after 7/7 and after 9/11,2
1,AndafterIt is particularly importantto be clear aboutwherewe stand,0
1,forthe attackers said thingsthat cannot be allowedto go unchallenged,0
5,They saidthey were avenging the prophet,2
1,That was wrong,0
1," it is the message of Islam, our principles and values,that have been betrayed and tainted",0
1,They referto Islamto justifywhatthey did,0
1,"From a religious viewpoint, I feelit is my responsibilityto saythat this has nothingto do with the message of our religion",0
1,"I would expect anyone,ifsomething was happening in the name of their country or in the name of their religion,to take a stand",0
1,As a Muslim scholar I haveto take that stand,0
1,there is also a wider political side to this equation,0
1,We condemnwhathappened in France,0
1,We condemn the violent extremismthat is targeting westerners,0
1,But it is not only westerners,0
1,We are reacting emotionallybecause12 people were killed in Paris,0
0,"there are hundreds being killed day in,day out in Syria and Iraq",2
1,still we send more bombs,0
1,We haveto look at the big picture,0
2,Lives matter,2
1,it is importantto be clearthat the lives of Muslims in Muslim majority countries have as much value as our own lives in the west,0
1,Whathappenedthis week is a tragedy heightened by familiarity,0
0,"for I met the cartoonist Charb (Stephane Charbonnier), the editor of Charlie Hebdo",2
0,who was among those killed on Wednesday,2
0,"We had a debatein which I told himthat I respected his freedomto saywhateverhe wantedto say,andthat there was no justification for any kind of censorship",2
0,But I also told himthat he hadto be clear about the wayhe was using that right,2
0,In 2008 his magazine fired a cartoonistwho made a joke about a Jewish link to President Sarkozy's son,2
0,"Wherewas the freedom of expression there,I asked the satirical magazine",2
0,"I was toldthat whenit comes to freedom of expressionthat there are limits,not everything can be said",2
1,"The double standard is troubling,to say the least",0
1,"I am shockedthat something as terrible as this has happened to Charb and his colleagues,but less surprisedthat there was a backlash against them",0
0,"There had been controversy concerning Charlie Hebdo on an almost six-monthly basis, and lots of threats",2
0,"To have a sense of humouris fine,I told them",2
1,to target an already stigmatised people in Franceis not really showing much courage,0
0,The shootings have been described as an act of war,2
1,I can understandwhysome might characteriseit that way,0
1,But they are wrongto do so,0
1,"isn't thisexactly whatthe violent extremists such as Da'esh, so-called Islamic State, want?",0
1,They wantto saythe west is at war with Islam,0
1,we areto take the action of marginal groups and usethat asevidencethat there is a war between Islam and the west,0
1,aren't we merelyfalling into a trap?,0
1,George Bush fell into that very trap immediately after 9/11 bycalling it the war on terror,0
1,actually he promoted it with his rhetoric,0
1,The mostwe can reasonably say nowisthat we are at war with violent extremists,0
1,they are coming from,0
1,why play that game at all?,0
1,Let's be specific:these are criminals exploiting Islam,0
1,The great majority of the victims are actually Muslim,0
1,There are tensions in many countries,0
1,things have been very difficult of late in France,0
1,Two recently published books reflect the atmosphere: very negative and very demoralising,0
1,The French Suicide by Eric Zemmour expresses the fearthat millions of Muslims might be colonising and transforming the country,0
1,(he is hopingthey will be helpedto leave),0
0,"and Michel Houellebecq's novel Submission,which predictsthat in 2022 an Islamic party will take over France",2
5,"Three years ago, Houellebecq saidIslam was the most stupid religion in the world",2
1,"In the UK, in terms of daily life, the situation is better",0
1,There isn't that feeling of permanent stigmatisation in the discourse,0
1,ashappens in France,0
1,"But even so, things feelas ifthey are changing for the worse",0
1,It is no accidentthat Ukip has been on the rise,0
1,in such a climate one feels the public discourse changing,0
1,There are parties happyto target migrants and to target Muslims,0
1,It's a driftwe haveto stop,0
1,in my view we actually have a shared responsibility,0
1,"Politicians, intellectuals, journalists, Muslims and people of other faiths (or none) must be clear and united about our common principles",0
1,We need politicians with more on their minds thanwinning the next election,0
1,One sees difficult days ahead,0
1,asyesterday's dramatic events in France showed,0
1,"there is the issue of media organisations intent onpublishing the most offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons, claimingthat it would strike a blow for free speech",0
1,I support free speech,0
1,I would urgethem to desist,0
1,whatthey planto dois not courageousand will do nothingto afford people dignity,0
1,It will be another example oftargeting all Muslims,0
1,"It would saythat ifour fellow Muslim citizens are not part of the equation,we will targetnot the extremists-but Islam itself",0
1,It would hand the extremists a victorythey could scarcely have achieved for themselves,0
1,"In the United States today, the odds ofgetting a degreeare more tightly linked to family income than ever before, thanks to skyrocketing college costs and insufficient and misallocated federal and state financial aid funds",0
4,Althoughthe federal government distributes about $170bn a year in financial aid to many types of students attending many types of schools,2
1,many low-income families still haveto pay too much,0
4,Low-income families often end uppaying about 40% of their family income for a memberto attend community college,2
4,"for four-year colleges, the bill can add up to a whopping 59% of a family's earnings",2
4,Even middle-class families may be askedto spend or borrow a quarter of their annual incometo finance one child's attendance at a public university,2
1,whilethe costs of a private one are yet higher,0
1,"As a result, many families of modest means are unableto afford college",0
1,"Students from middle- and low-income families have also becomemore likelyto drop out from public colleges and universities,leaving with debtsthey can't affordto pay backrather than degrees",0
1,But these are more than just personal tragedies,0
1,they represent a significant loss to America's economy and competitiveness for decadesto come,0
0,"On Friday, President Obama offered a simple, universal solution: free tuition for two years at community colleges for studentswho maintain a 2.5 grade point average, attend at least half-time and make steady progress towardscompleting their program",2
0,The federal government would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college,2
0,participating states would be expectedto pick up the rest,2
1,The last timea president did something this bold on higher educationwas the original Higher Education Act of 1965,0
0,"Then, President Lyndon Johnson had a huge Democratic majority in Congressto support his proposal",2
1,"President Obama, on the other hand, faces a tougher road in a government run by Republicans",0
1,who are reluctantto supportspending more moneyto help poor and middle class people,0
1,yet they should forego partisanship and take this legislation seriously,0
1,Instead ofbeing available only to the poorest students(like Pell grants) free community college tuition would be available for all,0
1,"The most powerful and enduring American social policies -Social Security, infrastructure investments like the highway system and indeed public education itself- have always benefitted everyone",0
1,America's outdated student aid policies simply aren't fulfilling their mission and are instead actively failingto make college affordable for all students,0
1,"And, unlike many other proposalsto fix the twin problems of college affordability and student debt focused on four-year programs,free community college has the potentialto meet the immediate needs of employers",0
1,who often saythat they cannot find potential candidates with needed skills,0
1,"Community college programs in fields like nursing, technology and even management are designedto give students the skillsthat employers need more quickly than the average bachelor's degree program",0
1,Obama's plan is far from perfect,0
1,It is not a catch-all solution,0
1,other major problems in American higher education still needto be addressed- including for-profit collegesthat consume vast amounts of federal aid dollars but often leave students with little more than terrible debt burdens,0
1,The costs of private and public four-year institutions should not be ignored,0
1,so that the number of bachelor degree graduates will again rise,0
1,And the President's proposal only gives students a discount on tuition,0
2,which is just one part (albeit a major one) of the cost ofgoing to school,2
1,"Yet there is no questionthat Congress should,ifanything,seek to outdo Obama with an even more ambitious proposal, rather than negotiateto reduce his package",0
1,They should not letthis proposal die upon arrival,0
1,Families can't affordto wait through more years of inaction,0
3,"[Editor'snote:The author advised the White House on this effort, but was not compensated for her work",1
5,"At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronouncedthat TV debates were ""here to stay""",2
5,"It was his confident declaration that:""We will have them in every election in the futureandthat is a really good thing for democracy.""",2
1,Many others thought so too,0
4,More than 20 million people watched some or all of them,2
1,They engaged voters in waysthat we hadn't seen before in Britain,0
1,"To many, it was unthinkablethat they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections",0
1,It gives me no pleasureto saythat I have always had great doubtsthat this was really the case,0
1,"Forit to be true,you hadto trust the Tory leadernot to change his mind",0
1,TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances,0
1,Mr Cameron had demanded thembecausethat iswhatopposition leaders nearly always do,0
1,Nick Clegg wantedto gain exposurethat no previous third party leader had enjoyed,0
1,"In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxiousto be seentryingto connect with alienated voters",0
1,The key was Gordon Brown,0
0,"Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates",2
1,"His people thoughthe had littleto loseand, in a typically Gordon Brownish way,he reckonedhe would come overasthe man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights",0
1,It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected,0
1,whatis most relevant towhatis happening nowisthat it didn't work outasMr Cameron anticipated either,0
1,"The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one",0
1,"presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the ""Cleggmania""that now seems so long ago",0
0,"On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC",2
0,"Among those also presentto comment on the resultswas Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster",2
1,it became clearthat his party had failedto secure a majority,0
1,he placed the blame on the TV debates,0
1,That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party,0
1,"Whetherit is entirely true or not,it has been engraved into the Tory soul",0
1,Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne,0
1,who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues foragreeing to the debates,0
1,The chancellor long ago told friendsthat he is not goingto make the same mistake twice,0
1,"Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates",0
1,"Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chiefwho has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations,is another key figurewho believesit is all downside for them",0
1,The first reasonthat David Cameron and his advisers are against debatesis the traditional one,0
1,He doesn't wantto concede equality of status to his opponents,0
1,The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers,0
5,"The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally:""Ifyou are the incumbent,debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents.It is a rigged game.""",2
1,"It is not,asis often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the rightthat most worries the prime minister",0
1,His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband,0
1,TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunityto secure mass exposure to voters scepticalthat he is up tobeing prime ministerand getthem to reconsider their view,0
1,"So poor are his personal ratings,Mr Miliband might only haveto turn up and string together a few half-decent sentencesandmore people would think better of him",0
1,The hopethat their man could benefit byexceeding low expectationsiswhyLabour is desperate for debatesto happen,0
1,Which makesthe Tories equally desperateforthem notto happen,0
1,"The Conservatives,aswe saw last week with their ""dodgy dossier"" about Labour's spending plans,wantto revert to an old-fashioned model of electionin which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' toursin which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press,to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda",0
1,"So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their powerto prevent TV debates fromhappening at this election",0
1,The broadcasters and the other parties wantedto begin negotiations about the format last spring,0
1,The Tories stalled,0
5,sayingthey wouldn't starttalking until October,2
0,"Whenthe negotiations finally got under way,I am told, and by a variety of different sources,that the Conservatives were determinedto block any progress toward agreement",2
5,"""Atevery stage, they soughtto put obstacles in the way,""says one source",2
5,"Another confirms:""The Tories keptthrowing spanners in the works.""",2
5,"According to a third:""All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives.""",2
0,"Last time around, ""a heads of agreement"" about the debates had been written by December",2
1,"This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that",0
0,The last meeting was just before Christmas,2
5,"""Wedidn't get anywhere because of the Tories,""says one source, an accountthat is again corroborated by others",2
0,I have learnedthat a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone,2
0,It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives,2
1,No new date has been set,0
1,The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates isthat he won't do itunlessthe Greens are included,0
1,I happento agreethat the Greens oughtto be represented in one debate,0
1,"There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendationthat Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as ""major"" parties for the purposes ofallocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens",0
1,They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better,0
0,They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip,2
1,So I agreethat it would be fairto include the Greens - and hoot with laughterto hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron,0
1,Whendid he become obsessed withchampioning the rights of minority parties?,0
1,Who knewhe had such a passionto debate with Natalie Bennett?,0
1,"In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible",0
1,"Byrunning away from debates,the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself",0
5,"Says one senior government figure:""Cameron doesn't likebeing called chicken.""",2
1,the Cameron brand is supposedto be the strong and confident leader,0
1,"whyis he frit ofdebating Ed Miliband, a manthe Tories keeptellingus is hopelessly weak?",0
1,Won't it simply look badto deny TV debates to the voters?,0
1,"Yes, it will",0
1,"the Tories are calculatingthat any fuss will be short-lived, soon forgotten and, in the end,not that many voters will punish them for it,especially iftheir spinners can successfully sow confusion aboutwho is responsible",0
1,The Tories also bargainthat the press won't make that big a deal of it,0
1,"About that, they may be right",0
1,There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaignthat their capacityto shape the agendawas reduced by the TV debates,0
1,There are journalists and editorswho will be secretly happyifthey don't happen again,0
1,I thinkthe chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada,0
1,Could anything change that?,0
1,"Some suggestthat the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threatento stage debates without him - ""empty chair""him in the jargon",0
1,Labour and the Lib Dems hopethis will happen,0
1,Number 10 is assumingthat the BBC wouldn't have the nerve,0
1,the other broadcasters will follow its lead,0
1,holding a debate without Mr Cameronmight anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage,0
1,A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Torieswhenthey wantto project him as the statesman floating above the fray,0
1,A more realistic wayto flush him outwould beto strip him of the Green figleafhe is using as his pretext fornot debating,0
1,The broadcasters could redraft their proposalto include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates,0
1,"Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could saythat they'd be contentforher to participate",0
1,I thinkthey would,0
1,Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen onincluding the Greens,0
0,who have been taking votes off both of them,2
1,"whenit comes to the crunch,they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all",0
1,"Even then, the Tories are so determinedto avoid TV debatesthat they'd most likely concoct another pretext forsabotaging them",0
1,But at least everyone would then be crystal clearwho isto blame,0
