1,This iswhatthe president's cynical manipulation of the Hispanic community has delivered:a hardening of American attitudes,0
1,The same distancing will likely occur between blacks and whitesasthe demonstrations over the grand jury decisions in Ferguson and Staten Island roll on,0
1,only recently a sizable majority of blacks and whites declaredthemselves comfortable with the state of race relations in the country,0
1,pictures of looting and the inflammatory rhetoric of self-interested activists like Al Sharpton will inevitably sharpen racial divides,0
1,"The insistent proclamations from Attorney General Eric Holderthat our justice system is biased,and the president's agreementthat the law ""feelslikeit's being applied in a discriminatory fashion,""do not help",0
1,"Today, Obama's well-honed political tactics ofdividing and conquering-- so essential toelecting a virtual nobody to the Oval Office-- have come asunder",0
1,The interest groups wooed by the president have begunto turn against him,0
1,Some feel betrayed,0
1,others understandthat their demands have isolated them from their fellow countrymen,0
4,The only group still giving the president more than a 50 percent approval rating is voters under 3,2
1,Forthe rest of the poor boobs not caught up in the Obama splinter sweep-- they are eagerto elect a successorwho might look out for them,0
1,"Turns out,those forgotten folks are actually in the majority, and just voted in a Republican Senate",0
4,"According to the Quinnipiac poll, 48 percent of voters thinkimmigrants living in the U.S  illegally should be allowedto stay",2
4,"That's down from 57 percent last year, and lower than ever",2
4," some 35 percent of the voting public thinksundocumented aliens should be deported -- a record high, and up from 26 percent last year",2
1,That's in spite of insistent hectoring from the White House about the moral imperative ofproviding a legal path for thosewho are here illegally,0
3,"Congratulations, Mr  Obama, forramping up opposition to immigration reform",1
1,Howto deal with illegal immigrantsis not the only issueon which the nation's attitudes are hardening,0
0,"Last August, after the shooting of Michael Brown (but before the grand jury decision in the case), a New York Times/CBS poll surveyed voters on their attitudes about race",2
4,"Askedwhetherrace relations had improved or soured during President Obama's time in office,35 percent of respondents saidthey had gottenworse",2
4,52 percent saidthey had stayed the same,2
4,Only 10 percent thoughtthe president had had a positive impact on relations - 8 percent of whites and 17 percent of blacks,2
1,That is an impressive underachievement from our first African-American president,0
4," 78 percent of respondents,whenasked about ""race relations in your community,""saidthey were ""generally good.""",2
4,"That included 82 percent of whites and 73 percent of blacks -- a strong vote of confidence, especially from a groupthat was much less positive about the country as a whole, with only 47 percent sayingU.S  race relations were ""generally good.""",2
1,"This split suggeststhat people have absorbed the narrativethat our country has a race problem not from their personal experience in their own communities, but from the media or our political leaders",0
1,The most compelling aspect of that story line entails racial bias in law enforcement,0
1,"Many initiatives, fromdecriminalizing marijuana possession to de-emphasizing tactics like ""stop and frisk,""have been promulgated based on the factthat more blacks than whites end up on the wrong side of the law",0
1,"Holder has even dumbed down school discipline measures,arguingthey constitute an example of racial bias",0
1,The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga sheds some welcome light on this issue,0
4,"According to surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics over the past 20 years, the number of confrontations between Americans and the police has declined,ashas the use of force by law enforcement officials",2
4,"Most important, perhaps, isthat the declines were recorded not just for whites, but for all races",2
4,"In 2002, 173,000 African-Americans reported a ""use of force""; in 2011,that was down to 130,000",2
4,"Nearly 83 percent of blackswho were involved in trafficstops(the most numerous encounters) agreed with the statement,""WhenI was stopped by the police,the officers acted properly.""",2
4,That figure was up from 78 percent in 2002,2
4,"As for so-called ""street stops,""the Bureau reports,""In 2011, less than 1% of the 241.4 million U.S  residents age 16 or older were involved in a street stop""",2
4," ""no differences were observed in the percentage of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic populations age 16 or older involved in a street stop.""",2
1,So much for unfair profiling,0
4,"Under 3 percent of police encountersinvolve ""street stops"" of an involuntary nature",2
4,"of those stopped (likely not a happy crew), two-thirds saidthe cops behaved ""properly and respectfully.""",2
1,"This review does not suggest a law enforcement community reviled by the African-American community, or the country",0
1,"President Obama has triedto curry favor with blacks, Hispanics, women, the young and the poor byconvincing themthat they suffer from injustices,that they are victimized by the one percent, by law enforcement, by corporations or insurers -- or by Republicans",0
1,Americans aren't buying it,0
1,"Increasingly, they see a country victimized by an incompetent president",0
0,"In a case brought by three sex workers, the Supreme Court of Canada, in December 2013, struck down three provisions of the Canadian prostitution law",2

0,"In June 2014, the Canadian government introduced a new prostitution law, Bill C-36 ""Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act"",which entered into force on December 5",2
1,the Supreme Court had created the space for a radical change in the approach to sex work byreaffirmingthat human and constitutional rights apply to sex workers too,0
1,democratic procedures in Canada seemto have failed sex workers,0
5,"The Canadian Pivot Legal Society arguesthat Bill C-36 has been ""consistently misrepresented""andthat it ""will result in sweeping criminalisation of the sex industry"",including sex workers themselves",2
1,"Others have calledit a ""hate law""",0
1,"becausethe safety and security of sex workers was, in fact, not the priority for somewho voted for the Bill C-36",0
5,"One of the Senators, Donald Plett, clearly stated his priority in this regard:""We don't wantto make life safe for prostitutes;we wantto do away with prostitution.""",2
1,Canada is not the only statethat has passed questionable legislation on sex work,0
5,""".[S]tates frequently deny sex workers the same human and legislative rights and protections afforded to other workers and citizens,""says sex work researcher Jay Levy",2
1,The question is:Howdo human rights apply to sex workersandwhat laws and policiesshould states make?,0
1,"Howshould sex worklaws look like,ifhuman rights areto be respected to the fullest extent?",0
1,The answer to these questions is controversial - both philosophically and politically,0
1,"In the past year, numerous countries have put sex work policies on their political agenda - for different reasons and with different goals and outcomes",0
1,"There are numerous examples worldwide,wherethe courts have upheld sex workers' human rights and questioned existing prostitution laws or filled legal grey areas",0
0,"In New Zealand,wheresex work is decriminalised,a sex worker won a case for sexual harassment against a brothel owner",2
0,"In New York, 1,900 strip club dancers won a labour rights case against their employer",2
0,who will haveto pay them at least $10m in compensation,2
0,Recently an Austrian court has ruledthat the cost of forced health checks imposed on sex workers hadto be reimbursed,2
0,"Both in Germany and in Austria, court rulings abolished to notion of prostitution asbeing ""immoral""",2
1,thus opening up the space for legal reform and the recognition of sex work as work,0
0,"The European Court of Justice has repeatedly ruledthat ""prostitution"" is an ""economic activity""andthat within the European Union member states cannot restrict ""freedom of movement"",not even for sex workers",2
1,court rulings are useful and necessary inreminding usthat sex workers have rights too,0
1,relying solely on courtsto read human rights into existing legislationcannot be the sole answer to injusticesthat sex workers face,0
1,Democracies needto step into make lawsthat actually improve sex workers' lives,0
1,- a goalthat has proven difficultto reach,0
1,"Historically marginalised and stigmatised,sex workers have a hard time inpushing for a reform of prostitution laws",0
1,"Most politicians, especially if male and heterosexual, do not wishto be associated with sex work",0
1,Prejudices and lack of knowledge about the topic as well as the unwillingnessto engage with sex workersthemselves have provento be hard obstacles to surmount,0
1,"Often, sex workers are heard in consultation processes",0
1,their views and political claims aren't always taken seriously,0
1,"By contrast, anti-prostitution activists calling for a world without prostitution have been far more successful in their lobbying efforts against sex work",0
1,They also explicitly distance themselves from self-identified sex workers,0
1,who they often accuse ofbeing nothing but criminals,0
1,anti-prostitution activists have managedto ally themselves with mostly sexually and socially conservative groups in their call for the suppression of sex work,0
0,"using slogans like""end demand"" or ""abolish prostitution now"",they have been calling for the so-called ""Swedish Model"",in which the act of selling sex is formally decriminalised,whileclients are charged with a monetary fine",2
1,"Byincreasing the cost of a sexual transaction,the law should work as a deterrent",0
0,"A variation of the law has been implemented in other small countries, such as Norway, Iceland, and, most recently, Northern Ireland",2
1,Supporters of this approach claimthat only this particular law will reduce human trafficking as well as prostitution,0
1, the Swedish approach comes with many flaws and open questions,0
1,Becauseits goal is a society without sex workers,0
1,the law does not intendto provide any guidance on the lawswe need in a society with sex workers,0
1,Norway is consideringrepealing the law,0
1,the evaluation of the law has not been ableto prove its success,0
4,the EUROSTAT report on human trafficking does not point to a decrease in human trafficking in Sweden,2
1,sex workers' working conditions have worsened,0
1," the ""Swedish Approach"" criminalises any attemptto create safe working environments for sex workers",0
0,"anyone renting indoor space to sex workers can be charged with ""pimping""",2
0,"Ironically, this provision has not reduced pimping, but induced many landlordsto put sex workers on the streetsin orderto avoid a fine for ""pimping"",asthe so-called ""Operation homeless"" has shown in Norway",2
0, Sweden does not allow immigration for the purposes of prostitution and has been deporting migrant sex workers,2
1,who are still seen a problem of public order and security,0
0,It wasn't until 2011that a Swedish Court ruledthat deporting citizens of the European Union selling sex in Sweden was illegal,2

0,A Special Committee of French Senate excluded the provision criminalising clients from the proposed new prostitution law in summer 2014 - based on the recommendations of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights,2
1,"So far, it is unclearwhetherFrance will go forward with the law at all",0
0,"Britain has also excluded the provision criminalising the purchase of sex from its ""Modern Slavery Bill""",2

1, the existing law casts sex workers simultaneously as dangerous to society and as victimsto be forcefully protected from their own choices,0

0,"On December 11, 1917,a mere two days after the above letter was written,British General Edmund Allenby entered Jerusalem triumphantly through the Jaffa gate",2
0,the city became an occupied territory,2
5,"On this historic occasion, Allenby reportedly declaredthat ""the wars of the crusades are now complete""",2
1,"Allenby's statement is a powerful reminderthat the British entry into Jerusalem was a continuation of and a ""successful"" conclusion to the Crusades",0
1, Allenby's statement introduces a critical epistemic connection between the modern British colonial project in Palestine and the Crusades of the 11-14th century,0
5,"The then Prime Minister David Lloyd George described the capture of Jerusalem as ""a Christmas present for the British people""",2
0,he had advisedAllenby to take the city before the Holidays,2
1,"Allenby's statement on the Crusades was not an isolated one,asillustrated by a number of British press and book publications from the period",0
5,"For example, Punch ran a headline on December 19, 1917declaring ""the Last Crusade"" with an illustration of ""Richard Coeur de Lion looking down towards Jerusalem and nodding contentedly, 'Mydream comes true!'""",2
5,"The British press was initially instructed in a ""private and confidential"" memo dated November 15, 1917,not to refer to the ""military operations against Turkey in any sense as a Holy War, a modern Crusade, or anythingwhateverto do with religious questions""",2
0," the press after a brief period ignored the instructions and startedusing the word ""Crusade"" indiscussing the occupation of Jerusalem",2
1,The memo was intendedto prevent any friction with Muslim troops recruited from British coloniesto fight in the war and avoidharming the alliance with Sharif Hussein of Mecca,0
1,"More importantly, the British Department of Information itself beganto usethe word ""Crusade"" to convey a very distinctive religious and historical connection to earlier periods",0
5,"The department celebrated in a telegram from Palestinethat ""two of the commanderswho have played a great part in the South Palestine campaignare descended from knightswho fought in the wars of the Crusades""",2
0,"A few months after the conquest of Jerusalem, the Department of Information produced a 40-minute documentary entitled""The New Crusades:With the British Forces on the Palestine Front"", thus articulating the new colonial adventure in distinctive religious terms",2

1,"There was a clear urgeto frame the colonisation project in Palestine in religious terms and view it as a continuation of the earlier Muslim-Christian conflict, despite claims offighting the Ottomans on the basis of European secularism and anti-religious modernity",0
1,The British were not the only ones thinking in these terms,0
5,"In his book The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity,Tariq Ali describeshowthe French commander Henri Gouraud uponentering Damascus with his troops,went to Saladin's tomb, kicked it and proclaimed;""The Crusades have ended now!Awake Saladin, we have returned!My presence here consecrates the victory of the Cross over the Crescent""",2
1,"The idea of the ""Crusade"" was incorporated into the support extended to the Zionist movement and the planto establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine",0
1, theological interpretations and attempts atrecreating the biblical pastwere aimed atushering in a distorted extreme right-wing Christian vision of the worldthat involved Israel as a stepping stone for its realisation in anticipation of the Second Coming,0
1,The British Occupation in 1917 madeit possibleto put into action the Balfour Declaration and the plan forbuilding a Jewish homeland at the expense of the Palestinians,0
1,The British undertook this project not out of love or concern for Jews,0
1,"on the contrary some of the strongest supporters of Zionism were ardent anti-Semites, including Lord Balfour himself",0
1,"Europe's theoretically constructed racist, bigoted and intolerant attitudes and policies towards Jews were the primary reason forsupporting Zionism",0
1,"December 11, 1917 isthe day that Jerusalem was lost",0
1,"On this date, Palestine enteredthe colonial tunnel and the dispossession of its indigenous population began",0
1,"From this date forward, Palestine, Jerusalem and the Palestinians were set on a course of confrontation with the British and the Zionists",0
1,who worked togetherto create a national home for the Jewish people,0
0,"the 1948 Nakba led to the physical expulsion of some 750,000 Palestinians",2
1,it is the British occupation in 1917 followed by the Mandatethat sealed Palestine's fate as the last colonial projectto be commissioned,0
1," Zionism was incubated in the British colonial womb with an umbilical cord connected to Europe's settler, colonial and racist epistemology",0
1,The British occupation madeit possible for Zionismto get a foothold in Palestine,0
1,"Whatfollowedwas the tormenting of the Palestinians through ethnic cleansing and expulsion,massacres, home demolitions, settlement expansions, land confiscation, everyday violence, attacks on al-Aqsa,building an Apartheid Wall and issuing more than 40 lawsdescriminating Palestinians",0
1,The last chapter of this story will be written by the Palestinians and their allies around the world,0

4,"At the event, held in Santiago de Compostela in Spain, the organizers releaseda studythat said a third of all tourists worldwideannually are pilgrims",2
4,The U.N  puts the total number of people going on a pilgrimage each year at 330 million,2

0,Each hour of the six-hour series focuses on American pilgrims making one of these historic journeys,2
1,Some of these seekers don't fit the stereotype of spiritual travelers,0
0,"Last May I traveled with 40 wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistanto bathe in the sacred waters of Lourdes, France",2

0,Some of the soldiers were in wheelchairs,2
0,others were being pushed on hospital gurneys,2
1,They had already received excellent medical care,0
1,they still longed for something,0
1,They needed healing,0
1,That sense of openness captures the spirit of many pilgrims,0

1,They're tough physically,0
1,they're tough mentally,0
1,"yet whenyou arrive at the destination,often with a groupyou've bonded with along the way,a pilgrimage can be magical like few gatherings on earth",0

1,They allowpilgrims to escape the ordinary and encounter the extraordinary,0
1,"It's a harder wayto experience faith, perhaps",0
1,ultimately it can be more fulfilling,0
1,And it's one step in the direction ofmakingreligion a viable force in the digital age,0
0,"The brutal and tragic murders of 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris - 10 staff members and two police officers - by masked gunmen has triggered an outpouring of shock and grief, not only in France but around the world",2

1,",the collateral damage to French and European Muslims has already been done, despiteone of the fallen police officers being a Muslim",0
1,"With the strength of the Front National in France, UKIP in Britain and other anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant currents across Europe, a popular or populist backlash is almost inevitable",0
1,"Inneighbouring Germany,the thousands of Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West (PEGIDA)who have turned out to rallies, though still small enoughto be labelled a ""flop"",has setalarm bells ringing to the extentthat strong counter protests have taken place",0
1,"Like Muslimswho fantasise about an ahistorical caliphate, conservative Europeanswho dream of a bygone utopia of a Europe uncontaminated by Islam or immigration,miss the realitythat the ""Islamisation of the West"" occurred centuries ago",0
1,"Islamic civilisation is so hard-wired into Europe's cultural, social and intellectual DNAthat it would be impossibleto expunge its influence",0
1,"The same applies in the other direction, in light of Christendom's and the West's powerful influence on Arab and Islamic society",0
1,"In addition to the philosophy, science, literature and art of the Muslim worldwhich profoundly shaped the European Renaissance,Islamic culture had some far more unexpected and surprising influences on western civilisation",0
1,"One man in particular,for whom no statues or memorials stand anywhere in Europeandvery few westerners have heard of,is possibly the most unsung cultural, style and musical icon in European history",0
0,"In the ninth century, Ziryab, Cordoba's most sought-after hipster, brought into vogue the idea of seasonal fashions, steering history's catwalk towards the fashion slavery of the 21st century",2
0,"This Sultan of Style also added a fifth pair of strings to the Arab ""oud"", paving the way to the European lute",2

1,"Fashion, fine food and rhythm are notwhatEuropeans tend to associate with Muslims or Islam today",0

1,As someonewho is well aware of the destructive influence of violent Islamism in the Middle East,0
1,"I can, at a certain level, sympathise with fears in the West over radicalisation",0
1,"But Islamic extremism is mostly a threat to Muslim societies, not to Europe",0
1,"a minority has never, in history, imposed its will on a majority, except in the form of a military conqueror",0
1,This exaggerated sense of threat can be seen in the enormous hysteria in segments of the media and among some politicians regarding the small trickle of European jihadistswho have goneto fight in Syria,0
1,Althoughone gets the impressionthat Europe has sent forth a veritable Islamic army to the Levant,0
5,"the real number is around 3,000 from across the continent, including the dead and returned, according to an estimate by Gilles de Kerchove, the EU's anti- terrorism chief",2
1,Whileit is importantto be vigilant and to find effective waysto deal with the threat posed byreturning fighters,0
1,society must steer clear of stigmatising Europe's already marginalised and distrusted Muslim communities,0
2,This isbecauseit is unfairto blame an entire group for the behaviour of a tiny minority,2
1,it is also counterproductive,0
1,"asmarginalisation is a significant, but not the only, factor in radicalisation",0

2,Our nation's immigration laws can be difficultto understand,2
1,"Our Constitution, however, isn't complicated",0
1,Our system of government is simple,0
2,Congress writes the law,2

2,the judiciary interprets the law,2
2,The president does not make new law,2
2,"That concept is called the ""separation of powers,""",2
1,it's of core importance to our democracy,0
2,"As a bulwark against tyranny, our Founders determinedthat no single branch of government could perform all the functions of government--making, enforcing, and interpreting the law",2
1," our Founders took the classic powers of a king and divided them between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches",0

0,"The men were seized from a hotel and given long jail sentences on charges ofabetting terrorists, spreading false news and endangering national security",2
0,On Friday 2 January 2015 the Guardian published online an interview with Amal Clooney,2
0,"who represents Mohamed Fahmy, one of the three jailed journalists",2
0,The other two are Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste,2
0,"The interview,which ranged over many aspects of the case,was given in the wake of the appeal hearing in Cairo on 1 Januaryin which the three men were toldthey would haveto face a retrial",2

0,"I wrote a longer, fuller footnote",2
0,a correction was published online that evening and in print on Tuesday 6 January,2
0,"whatI had not initially realisedwasthat Clooney had co-authored an article for the Huffington Post website with Mark Wassouf,who also represents Fahmy, published on Sunday 4 January",2
0,"In it, primarily, she set out the issuesfacing the three men including Fahmy, but also addressing her concerns about the Guardian story",2
0,In it she raised a fresh concernof which we were unaware,2
5,"She described thosewho warned her of a possible arrestifany attempt was madeto publish the report as ""experts in Egyptian affairs""",2

5,"The Huffington Post story said:""An article was published in the Guardian newspaper on 2 January 2015statingthat officials threatened Amal Clooney with arrest in Egypt in connection with her representation of Fahmy",2

5,"As a result of these warnings,the IBA decidedthat it was not safeto hold the launch in Cairo,andthe authors were forcedto hold it in London instead",2
5,"This incident arose before Mrs Clooney's involvement in the Fahmy case,beforethe current president was in office and in a context entirely unrelated to this case",2
5,"More importantly, the focus today should not be on the risksthat lawyers or journalists faced in the past",2
5,"The focus should be on the risks of free speech in today's Egypt.""",2
0,the Guardian asked Clooney on 5 January for more details of the individualswho gave the warning,2

1,I am not ableto establish any more details about them,0
1,"I thinkthe Guardian believedthat, in the context of the interview, the ""they""to which Clooney referswere Egyptian officialswho had given the warning",0

0,I'm Methodist,2
1,"Now I am no religious scholar, but aren't there large differences between Christianity and Judaism?",0
1,The answer is yes,0
0,From that moment I beganto sort through my own faith,2
1,There are so many beautiful qualities about Judaism,0
1,"Many knowthat they set aside an entire day each week-Saturday, the seventh day-to pray and honor God as the creator",0
2,They callit Shabbos- the Sabbath,2
0,I can't remember the last time I devoted more than 20 minutes to this thought,2
0,I am extremely thankful to God forcreating the universeand forgiving me life,2
0,"But like most people, I have thingsto do on the weekendthat I can't accomplish on Sunday alone",2
1,I can't spend an entire day dedicated to prayer and rest,0
1,the Orthodox community does,0
0,it is one of the most interesting and beautiful ritualsI've ever seen,2
0,I've cometo realizethat the Jewish community is filled with wonderful people,2
0,"Because of my Jewish roots, several families have taken an interest in me, ""adopting"" me into their families and invited me into their homes",2
0,"I've begunstudying the Torah once a week and learning abouthowJews practice their religion,both in synagogue and at home",2

1,It will probably continue for yearsto come,0
1,One of the thingsthat make my faith exploration limitlessisthat my parents are no longer living,0
1,I have no encouragement or discouragement in my life from my parents; my life's direction completely up to me,0
1,"It's my job, then,to listen to God's word, and His convictions in my life",0
0,I have no real goal here,2

3,"As soonasI find outwhereit leads,you will know",1
1,The fall of Mosul and the quick territorial expansion of ISIL in Iraq took some by surprise,0
1,Whatcontributed to ISIL's quick successwas cooperation from local Sunni tribes and members of the traditionally secular and nationalist Baath party,0
1,This seemingly counterintuitive alliance has its rationale and deep roots in history,0
1,"The successful cooperation between radical Islamist factions, Sunni tribes and representatives of the former ruling party - currently commanders of paramilitary groups - can be traced back to the policies of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s",0
1,which aimedto foster closer ties between those espousing the ideas of political Islam and the Baath party,0
1,The historical preconditions for the advent of Islamist ideas in Iraq and their eager adoption by Sunni resistance forces are clearly discernible in the strategy proposed at the time by the then Iraqi president,0
0,"In 1986, at a meeting with representatives of the pan-Arab national command - the supreme ideological body of the Baath Party - Saddam Hussein offered a ceasefire, or even an alliance, between the party and the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Egypt and Sudan",2
0,"In practice, for the first time in its history the militant and secular Baath party declared its readinessto cooperate with representatives of the so-called political Islam",2
0,"In the same year, the Iraqi president also definedthe difference between the ""democratic, national, pan-Arab state"" and the ""religious state"" proclaimed by the Muslim Brotherhood",2
0,"Following in the footsteps of the founding father of Arab nationalism and of the pan-Arab Baath party Michel Aflaq, Saddam clearly declaredthat he was not an atheist,but warned against any attemptto establish a religious party with an either Sunni or Shia bias",2
1,Saddam's warning at the time was probably addressed at the Islamic Dawa party,0
1,which had a dominant role among the Shia community and was regarded as the main competitor of the Baath party,0
0,The president also rejected the traditional Islamic system of justice and denounced Islamic law as an obsolete legal tradition,2
1,It was only after 1990sthat Saddam decidedto focus on relations with Islamic movements,0
1,publications dedicated to the topic beganto appear in the media,0
1,The conditions could not have been more favourable,0
2,becausethe war with Iran had ended,2
1,"the propaganda machine was busypainting a picture of Saddam as the indisputable victor,despite the enormous war-related losses",0
0,"In 1991, Iraq launched a new campaign",2
0,"which Saddam described as ""the mother of all battles"" against the United States and its allies",2
1,The president was yet again depicted as a hero in the confrontation between Muslims and western forces,0
0,"the inscription""God is Great""was added to the Iraqi flag",2
0,the president promisedthat he would free Jerusalem,2
1,An attempt was madeto play down the failure of the campaign in Kuwait and the sanctions imposed bystepping up an openly pro-Islamic propaganda,0
0,"In 1993, under the weight of a crippling international embargo, the Iraqi president declared the beginning of the so-called religious campaign",2
1,The goal wasto gain control over religious sentiment among the Iraqi population,0
1,which was barely coping with the consequences of the two wars and the stringent sanctions,0
1,"Last but not least, an attempt was madeto reinvent and soften the image of the Baghdad regime as onethat is pro-Islamic and, therefore, in conflictwith the ""forces of Islam's enemies""",0
0,The regime undertook demonstrative moves such asclosing night clubs and some restaurants and enforcing restrictions on alcohol sales,2
0,A large scale Quran studying campaign was undertaken,2
1,"Senior Sunni and Shia clerics took advantage of the situation and attemptedto further the interests of their respective communities,declaring open support for the line taken by the Iraqi leader",0
0,"In 1998, top-ranking party officials, including Vice President Izzat Ibrahim al- Douri, were openly demonstrating religious piety and devotion",2
1,The period after 1993 ushered in a renewed mosque building effort,0
0,"In 1989, a new religious university was founded and named after Saddam",2
1,The influence of radical Sunni teachings increasingly gained prominence in certain intellectual circles within Baghdad University,0
1,Whileone group openly espoused extreme conservative views,0
1,which today can be described as Salafi beliefs,0
1,the other blended in with the Sunni theosophical tradition and was influenced by the teachings of the Naqshbandiyya Order,0
5,"According to witness testimonies, both groups received financial and moral support from the same source - Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri",2
5,A member of the academic community has even allegedthat the vice president's support came with the blessing of Saddam,2
1,"The spread of the new ideologythat lay at the very heart of the religious campaignbeganto make inroads into the judicial system,with the incorporation of extreme and previously unknown punishments into the body of law",0
0,"By way of example, according to Decree No 59/1994 theft became punishable by amputation",2
1,The eventsthat are currently unfolding in Iraqwarrant the conclusionthat the advent of ISIL and its support from or collaboration with Iraqi Sunni structures would have been impossible without the historical preconditions outlined abovehaving already been firmly set in place,0
1,The former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki failedto strike a reasonable balance between the interests of all ethnic and religious groups in the country bysystematically marginalising the Sunni community,0
1,Another important reason is widespread corruption and the lack of a concept and strategy for the development of the country on the basis of the established constitutional orderthat is shared by all groups in society,0
1,"From 2003 to date, no Iraqi government has initiated and proposed an adequate policy for Sunni inclusion",0
1,"The programme for the de-Baathificaton of senior-ranking party officials(whose numbersome commentators put at more than 40,000)has resulted inmany losing their livelihood",0
1,"Due to its affiliation with the party, approximately one-third of the Iraqi population was effectively marginalised",0
1,"Scores of people - many of them young people, including officers in Saddam's army and former civil servants - have been stripped of the Baathist ideologythat they previously espousedandthat had dominated their social life",0
1,This void has been filled by Islam,0
1,"Since 2004, many Iraqi Sunnis have joined the ranks of the Iraqi resistance movement",0
0,"which brings together a number of prominent groups under its banner, such as the Naqshbandiyya Army, Al-Awda, Al-Qiyada al-Amma li Jaysh Al-Iraq (General Command of the Iraqi Army), Munazzamat al-Tahrir al-Iraqiya (Iraqi Liberation Organisation), Kataib Salah ad-Din (Salah al-Din Brigades), etc",2
1,"Despite the radical narrative so typical for purely Islamic organisations, those mentioned continueto rely on the propaganda postulates formerly employed by Saddam as cornerstones of their public rhetoric",0
1,"The crisis in Iraq has much clearer outlines todaythanit did a year ago,largely due to the refusal of the governmentto consider Sunni demands",0
1,It has logically escalated with the advent of ISIL from Syria and the forging of a strategic alliance with the main Sunni military groups,0
1,"At heart, these alliances represent the interests of the former members of the Baath party and of the principal Sunni tribal unions",0
1,Their attitude towards the Shia is strongly negative and clearly discernible in a number of claims with a conspiratorial bias,0
1,"Propaganda describes the Shia in a discriminatory manner,dating back to the medieval period of confrontation between the two communities",0
0,These include terms such as shu'ubiyya and safawiya,2
1,The same derogatory terms are also typical for ISIL propaganda,0
1,"Withoutequating ISIL and Iraqi opposition,they are apparently,albeittemporarily,aligned in the pursuit of a common goal -bringing about the demise of the government in Baghdad",0
1,which is regarded as a direct proponent of the interests of Iran and its ambitionto dominate the Sunnis in the Middle East,0
1,"This alliance, coupled with the markedly fragmented Iraqi political elite, has placed the country at a crossroads",0
1,"The extremist Islamism, compounded by the opportunism of the former political and military elite, has failedto be countered by an ideology based on a new national compromise",0
5,"asa senior-ranking international representative has declared,it is imperativethat Iraqi citizens considerwhetherthey can still live within the borders of a single state",2

1,But the effect on this stock or that currency could be as nothing compared to the eventual effect on the resources of nature,0
1,The gloopthat lubricates industrial lifecan remake the weather in various ways,0
1,"Most obviously, cheaper energy prices(many of which are still linked to the cost of crude)will incrementally increase the temptationto fritter away precious power -to leave the car engine idling, or to failto go upstairsto switch off that light",0
1,"Little habits matter, because, with the clock ticking remorselessly down towards climate catastrophe,every little hurts",0

1,whatcomes down soongoes back up,0
1,such direct effects may not prove so profound,0
1,Whatwill matter more in the longer termis the dynamic effect on the energy infrastructure,0
1,"For both good and ill, cheap oil disincentivises investment in change",0
1,"On the plus side, the most exploitative schemesto extract ever more fossil fuelsbecome less economic",0
1,"Already, oil companies are reviewing a planned $1 trillion in ventures, such as deep-sea drilling,that no longer make economic sense",0

1,asit will haveto,0
1,the world isto keep a lid on the warming,0
1,But at the same time cheap oil weakens market forcesthat might otherwise rein in energy use,0
1,The expectationthat fossil fuels would get scarcer and pricierhas forced capitalismto take investment in energy efficiency seriously,0
1,Manufacturers of electric cars and green fridges could get cold feet,0
1,there could likewise be an unravelling of the logic of developing renewable energy,0
1,which only stacks upwhenthe powerthat it generatesis less costly than carbon-based energy,0
1,That's not a sumthat works in favour of renewables in a free-market $50-a-barrel world,0

1,"Secondly, the government has the capacityto reform the security intuitionsin orderto reduce the level of corruption and eliminate political influence exercised by important power brokers",0

0,he came to the public with some new measuresthat would be undertakento ensurethat an attack like the Peshawar massacre would never happen again,2

1,"In the opinion of the prime minister, and several other political parties, this measure,which would take power away from Pakistan's civilian judiciary,was necessaryto win the fight against terror",0

0,"Like the Army Public School attackthat would come months later,the aftermath of carnage was grotesque, the bits and pieces of the instruments of justice, papers of pleadings, the black jackets worn by lawyers, spreadall over whathad become a crime scene",2
1,Attacks on courts are not the only problem in the adjudication of terrorism cases,0
1,"Terror suspects, in the caseswherethey are even apprehended,are rarely triedlet alone convicted",0
1,the war on terror has trundled on,0
1,Pakistan's Court system has lackedthe security or the power to conduct terrorism trials and produce convictions,0
4,"In numbers obtained from 2012, it was foundthat the conviction rate for terrorism cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,wheremany attacks were concentrated,was a paltry 4 percent",2
1,"In Punjab, the situation was not much better",0
4,In 2012 the Special Anti-Terrorism Court in that province heard 559 cases against terror suspects and 414 of these ended with acquittals,2

4,"Between 1990 and 2009, a timewhenPakistan suffered thousands of terrorist attacks and suicide bombings, the acquittal rate in terror caseswas 74 percent",2
1,The establishment of military courts for a period of two years is supposedto be a solution to all of this,0
1,the militarythat is bombing terrorist hideouts in the north of the countryis also given the task ofadjudicating the cases,0
1,"the new logic goes,terrorists will certainly be punishedandtragedies like Peshawar will never happen again",0

1,Hundreds of people were flogged and imprisoned simply forparticipating in normal political activitythat was banned under martial law,0
0,"In the present case, martial law has not been declared in Pakistan",2
1, turning over the adjudication of terror cases undoubtedly undermines the country's civilian judiciary,0
1, the secrecy surrounding military courts leavesthem open to charges ofcontravening legal principles and pursuing their own vendettas against this or that terrorist group instead of sticking to the principles of justice and obtaining convictions via fair procedures,0
1,"Giventhat military courts in Pakistan do not work under a system of legal precedent,little information exists as to the basis of convictions and acquittals",0
1,evidence is rarely madepublic,0
1,plenty of room is created for conspiracy theoriststo place doubt on any convictionthat is produced under their auspices,0

1,"The aftermath of every terror attack sees a burgeoning of just this sort of denial, whetted and promoted by groups themselves",0
1,the consequent moral murkiness makesit impossible for a Pakistani publicto see terrorism as a black and white issue,0

1,"it's one camp sayingit didn't,andthe other saying ""we have no idea but did it anyway""",0
1,"On several key points, the CIA is closer in substance to the Senate report than to its loudest defenders",0
5,"The Senate report foundthat the CIA was ""unprepared""to operate a detention and interrogation system",2
5,"The Agency's written response to the report says;""We fully agree""",2
5,"the CIA had ""no cadre of trained and experienced interrogators, little experience handling and moving prisoners, and no core competency in prison management",2
5,"The Agency had too few analysts and linguists with the expertise requiredto support[a detention] programme""",2
1, there is no disputethat the programme was started and run on the fly,0
1,A critical finding of the Senate report wasthat torturing detainees did not yield otherwise unobtainable actionable intelligence,0
5,"CIA director, John O Brennan, admittedthat the agency ""has not concludedthat it was the use of EITsthat allowedus to obtain useful information from detainees""",2
5,the CIA still maintainsthat it gained valuable intelligence from detainees,2
1,it is not saying the abusive methods produced it,0
5,"The Senate report also describeshowthe CIA sought out two psychiatrists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen,to construct the torture programme instead of actual experienced interrogators,on the assumptionthat long-established humane and lawful interrogation methods wouldn't work",2
5,"In its response, the CIA acknowledgedthat it hadto look beyond the agencyto find experts on ""non-standard means of interrogation""",2
5,it was not an area of expertisethat CIA officers or the US government possessed,2
5,"The CIA called MitchellandJessen's background ""so unique""that the agency ""would have been derelicthad[it] not sought them outwhenit became clearthat CIA would be heading into the uncharted territory of the programme""",2
1, the torture programme was so out of whack withwhatprofessional interrogators dothat the CIA hadto go outside the US governmentto findpeople to do it,0
1,There still are important areas of disagreement between the Senate report and the CIA,0
1,The CIA is too protective of its ownto acknowledge the full import of its descent into torture or to disavow the programme entirely,0
1,But the agency - unlike its loudest defenders - is not endorsingtorture as a means ofgaining intelligence or keepingthe country safe,0
1,basing the case against torture on its total ineffectivenessis a risky proposition,0
1,Torture produces a lot of information,0
1,victims frequently make things upto ease their suffering,0
1,they may also on occasion say things of some value,0
1,That'swhyit is importantto rememberthat torture is illegal under any circumstances regardless of its utility,0
1,"But in a democracy, the strength of legal norms depends partly on their acceptance by the public",0
1,the public shouldn't haveto be persuadedthat barbaric methods failto makethem safer,0
1,doing soreinforces their illegality,0
1,"The flurry of media appearances by Cheney and other torture defenders has created a false sensethat there is a genuine divide overwhethertorture""works""",0
1,But neither the CIA nor professional interrogators actually say that,0
1,we can continueto debate other aspects of the CIA programme,0
0,includingwhetherthose responsible should be sanctioned,2
1,let'sstoppretendingthat there are two legitimate sides to this particular story,0
1,The quiet truth behind the inescapable headlines about man's inhumanity to man isthat the world is actually becoming a more peaceful place,0
1,Deaths from war and conflict have been declining for decades,0
1,current trends continue,0
1,we can makethem rarer still,0
1,What mysterious forceis sowing peace among humankind?,0
1,One possible reason isthat there are more atheists and nonbelievers than ever before,0
4,"In America, millennials are the largest and least religious generation in the country's history",2
1,The trend toward secularization in the US mirrors the movement in Europe and throughout the developed world,0
4,"And poll after poll have shownthat the nonreligious also lean more progressive and more pacifist on a wide variety of issues relating to violence: torture, the death penalty, corporal punishment, military adventurism and more",2
4,"A Pew poll from 2009, well before the Senate released its devastating torture report last month, askedwhethertorturing suspected terrorists could be justifiedfoundthat the non-religious were most opposedto torture,with a combined 55% sayingthat it could rarely or never be justified",2
4,Gallup has also foundthat people with no religious preference are less supportive of the death penalty than any group of Christians,2
4,The non-religious are also among the most likelyto saythe invasion of Iraq was a mistake,2
4,"The religiously unaffiliated are also less likelythanChristians to believethat the US is superior to all other countries in the world, a hyper-patriotic attitudethat's hardly conducive to careful reflection about the use of American military power",2
1,"As longashumanity was in thrall to the violent morality of religious texts,our societies were warlike and cruel",0
5,"Asthe American revolutionary Thomas Paine said,belief in a cruel god makes a cruel man",2
1,"It's only in the last few decades,aswe've begunto cast these beliefs off,that we're making real moral progress",0
1,The influence of the non-religious shows is also evident on an international scale,0
2,"The nonprofit group Vision of Humanity publishes an annual Global Peace Index,which ranks countries on a broad spectrum of indicators, including violent crime, incarceration rates, weapon ownership, and military spending",2
0,Sociologist Phil Zuckerman summarizes their results in his new book Living the Secular Life,2
4,"according to their most recent rankings, among the top ten most peaceful nations on earth, all are among the least God-believing",2
4, eight of the ten are specifically among the least theistic nations on earth,2
5, of the bottom ten - the least peaceful nations - most ofthem are extremely religious,2
2,not every atheist is peacefuland notevery religious person is violent,2
1,Avowedly pacifist faiths like the Quakers or Unitarian Universalists have played an important role in peace movements,0
1,"in the other direction, there are lamentably prominent atheists like Sam Harris or the late Christopher Hitchenswho've been entirely too cavalier about imperialism and military aggression",0
1,"But in general, the trend isthat,asthe world becomes less religious,we can expectit to become even more peaceful",0
1,It's notas ifwe weren't warned about the CIA,0
5,"Some 50 years beforethe Senate Intelligence Committee issued its 500-page report on torture,former President Harry Truman published an opinion piece in the Washington Postassertingthat the CIA was out of controland calling for itto be broken up",2
0,"Truman's column appeared on December 22, 1963, a month to the day following US President John F Kennedy's assassination and 11 years after hehimself moved out of the White House",2
5,"Truman argued, as the presidentwho authorised its establishment in 1947,that the CIA had strayed from the missionhe had intended for it",2
5,"He had favoured creation of the CIAso that a president would haveone agency providing him with objective foreign intelligence, rather than havingto rely upon the often conflicting information being served up by the Departments of State, Defense, and otherswho ""slantedto conform to established positions of a given department""",2
1,"Viewing intelligence gathering as its sole mission,Truman was disturbed ""by the waythe CIA has been diverted from its original assignment",0
5,"It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government.""",2
5,"He saidhe had ""never had any thought""that the CIA would involve itself in ""cloak and dagger operations""",2
5,"But it hadwhich ""has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas""",2
1,It is clearly of some significancethat Truman published his piece just one month after Kennedy's assassination,0
1,Althoughthere is no evidencethat Truman was suggesting CIA involvement in the assassination,0
1,it is impossibleto believethat the late president's difficulties with the CIA were far from Truman's mind,0
1,"As a former presidentwho the Kennedy White House regularly briefed on foreign policy issues and decisions,Truman knewhowthe CIA essentially steamrolled Kennedy into the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (and other anti- Castro actions),leadingKennedy to tell a friendthat he wanted""to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds""",0
2,Kennedy never had the chanceto follow up on that idea,2
1,it was essentiallywhatTruman suggested a month after Kennedy's death,0
1,"Obviously, Truman's recommendation had no effect",0
1, the Washington establishment apparently took actionto seethat Truman's piece disappeared almost without a trace (easier in those pre-internet days),0
5,"According to former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, the Washington Post only published the piece in its morning edition,pulling it from view after that (a peculiar wayto treat an opinion piece by a former president, especially on such a weighty issue)",2
5,"McGovern also reportsthat former CIA Director Allen Dulles,who Kennedy fired after the Bay of Pigs debacle,actually flew down to Truman's home in Independence, Missourito get the former president to retract",2
0,AlthoughDulles reported back to his friendsthat Truman had indeed recanted,2
1,he clearly never did,0
5," six months afterpublishing the column in the Post,Truman wrote to the managing editor of Look Magazinethat he intended the CIA as an intelligence gathering agency only and not a placewhere""strange activities"" would be launched",2
1,"No doubt, the Bay of Pigs and Cuba, in general, were not the only examples of CIA interventionsthat disturbed Truman",0
1,"In the years between the end of Truman's administration and his Washington Post column, the CIA had orchestrated the overthrow of governments in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Congo (1960), Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964)",0
1,"Within a year following Truman's death, the CIA successfully brought down the Allende government in Chile (1973)",0
1,"As for its activities since, its intelligence activities have clearly continuedto be a low priority",0
1,"(it has gottenIraq wrong from the start, culminating most recently in its failureto predict the rise of ISIL)",0
1,"whatTruman called its ""cloak and dagger"" operations,have proliferated",0
5,"According to historian William Blum,writing in Foreign Policy Journal,in the last 69 years, the CIA has (often in conjunction with the military) ""(1)attemptedto overthrow more than 50 governments,most of which were democratically-elected, (2)attemptedto suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20countries, (3) grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries, (4) dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries, (5) attemptedto assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders.""",2
1,"And now there are the horrific reports of torture and, equally appalling, the defense of CIA torture by former CIA driectors, other top CIA officials and, most enthusiastically, former Vice President Dick Cheney",0
5,"who famously told NBC five days after 9/11that it was now time for US intelligence agenciesto operate on the ""dark side""",2
1,That is the context of the torture debate,0
1,"AsTruman understood,the CIA was dangerous and should be broken up or, in Kennedy's words, ""splinter[ed] into a thousand pieces and scatter[ed] to the winds""",0
2,That was 50 years and nine presidents ago,2
1,"since John F Kennedy, no president has challenged the CIA",0

0,"In April 2009,harrowing interviews with the 14 ""high-value detainees"", conducted by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, were leaked",2
0,in August 2009 an internal CIA report from 2004 into the agency's detention and interrogation policies after 9/11 was released,2
5,"containing details ofhowone prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri (one of the three men waterboarded, along with Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Muhammad), was physically abusedand threatened with a gun and power drillwhilehooded at a ""black site"" in Thailand",2
0,In 2010 I wrote a detailed analysis of the secret detention programme for a UN study,2
0,"in which I soughtto ascertain the identities of the 94 ""ghost prisoners"" in CIA custody - including 28 subjected to ""enhanced interrogation"" ",2
0,who were referredtoin a memo from 2005 by OLC lawyer Steven G Bradburythat was released by the Obama administration in April 2009,2
0,"Another major report, by the Constitution Project, was published in 2013",2
1,althoughsome of the gruesome facts about the torture programme were known,0
1,the Senate Intelligence Committee's report provides far more,0
1,The report states,0
5,"""sleep deprivation involvedkeepingdetainees awakefor up to 180 hours""",2
5,"althoughsome ""experienced disturbing hallucinations"", in at least two casesthe CIA continued its abuse",2
1,"These examples - and many more in the summary - demonstrate clearly the committee's conclusionthat the interrogations ""were brutal and far worsethanthe CIA represented to policymakers and others""",0
5,"Perhaps more importantly, however, the committee also concludesthat torture was ""not an effective means ofacquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"",that the CIA made ""inaccurate claims"" about the ""effectiveness"" of the programme in an attemptto justify itandthat it led to friction with other agenciesthat endangered national security, as well as providing false statementsthat led to costly and worthless wild goose chases",2
5,The report also concludesthat non-approved techniques were used widely,2
5,"andthat ""[a]t least17 detaineeswere subjectedto CIA enhanced interrogation techniques without authorisation from CIA headquarters"",andthat ""multiple detainees were subjected to techniquesthat were applied in waysthat diverged from the specific authorisation,or were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques by interrogators",2
5,"who had not been authorisedto use them""",2
1,The committee was also critical of the central role played by two contract psychologists from the SERE programme,0
5,"even thoughneither of them ""had any experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialised knowledge of al-Qaeda, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise""",2
5,"The committee also concludedthat Steven Bradbury's numbers were wrong,andthat the CIA ""detained at least 119 individuals,of whom at least 39 were subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques""",2
5," of these 119 ""at least 26were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard""in the still-secret Bush administration memorandum establishing the programme in September 2001",2
1,"In the days and weeksto come,there will be concerted efforts by the CIA and by former Bush administration officialsto defend their actions",0
1,the report makes clearthat any kind of defence is untenable,0
1,"Crimes were committed, authorised at the highest level of the US government",0
5,"althoughObama came into office in 2009expressing ""a beliefthat we needto look forwardas opposed tolooking backwards""",2
1,that is not acceptable,0
1,"The Senate Intelligence Committee's torture report - all 6,700 pages of it, costing $40m and involving an analysis of more than six million pages of classified documents - must be the trigger not just for an airing of apologies, but for thosewho instigated and authorised the torture programmeto be held accountable - up to and including President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney",0
1,"The rise of shale has posed a rare challenge to Middle Eastern oil,culminating in a global oil price war and moving OPEC membersto slashprofits to retain market share",0
1,whenOPEC's hegemony over the oil markets has been challenged,0
1,letus not forgetthere is another abundant natural energy resourcethe Middle East possesses - the sun,0
1,The abundance of sunlight (and therefore solar power) offers Middle Eastern energy producers an opportunityto achieve first-move advantage in a marketthat appearsto be the longer-term future of energy,0
1,"In light of recent instability in oil markets, the importance of alternative renewable energies, particularly solar, has becomeall the more pronounced",0
1,The drop in oil prices has precipitated an efficiency rush in energy production in all producer nations,0
1,"In the US, oil producers are leaving no stone unturned in the huntto become as efficient and sustainable as possible",0
1,"In Europe,there is a renewed push for renewable energy",0
0,some countries like the UK are also pursuing nuclear energy as a longer-term solution,2
1,"In the Gulf,there are similar measures taking placeto become more efficient in a more competitive energy market",0
1,"increasingly, they are turningto solarto achieve it",0
4,"The Gulf states remains one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and make up the biggest exporting members of OPEC, especially Saudi Arabia",2
1,Whilesome of these countries can affordto swallow current oil prices for now,0
1,they will nonetheless findit difficultto maintain their domestic budgets,0
1,- allOPEC countries choseto cut pricesin orderto hold onto market share,0
1,this meansslashing profit,0
1,It would not be unprecedented for these countriesto encounter domestic trouble,0
1,"The other, more serious concerns for these major oil producers, is the increasing consumer demand in their own countries",0
1,"In past decades, the region has been ableto sustain luxury alongside completely inefficient energy policiesthrough government subsidies",0
1,But the entire energy outlook for the region is changing rapidly,0
1,"Rising populations, a growing middle class, industry diversification and increasing consumerism has turned a number of countries in the Gulf region into major energy consumers",0
4,"In Saudi Arabia,oil accounts for over 65 percent of all electricity production",2
4,in Kuwait it is 71 percent,2
4,in Lebanon it is 94 percent,2
4,in Yemen it's an astonishing 100 percent,2
1,This represents an energy policythat is inefficient and in the long run - unsustainable,0
4,Saudi Arabia is the biggest petroleum consumer in the region,2
4,"it is the world's second biggest consumer of total primary energy, 60 percent ofwhich is petroleum-based",2
1,"But most importantly, it paints a distressing future for the region's oil export industry",0
1,consumer demand continuesto grow,0
1,it will eventually result in downward pressure on oil exports and could startaffecting subsidies,0
1,"Without a robust and efficient energy balance in the region, it will inevitably lead to these producer nations becoming less profitable with a weaker export outlook",0
1,"And with competitors in the oil market like Russia, Iran and the North American shale, this is a long-term dynamicthat will undermine Middle East's global energy dominance",0
1, the possibilities associated withharnessing Middle Eastern solar energycould be a game-changer,0
1,"Solar is becoming much cheaperto invest in,andnow has an established and ever improving infrastructure",0
1,Substantial investment in solar will act as a shield for the region's more valued commodity; oil,0
4,"Saudi Arabia alone for example, could have made$43.8bn in additional oil revenue in 2013 were it not for its spiralling domestic consumption",2
1,It also would have acted as a massive stimulus to the country's finances,0
0,"Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, announcedit would be making solar energy investments across the country in an attemptto diversify the country's energy supplies",2
0,It is also expectedto conserve the country's oil resources primarily for export,2
1,It has been a slow process but is nonetheless an important one for the future of the solar energy sector,0
1,"One of the biggest success variables for any solar energy project is not just investment, but location",0
1,The Middle East's solar industry is one of the most economically sustainable and acts as the best conserver of the region's oil resources,0
1,"It is also a very strong investment opportunity for those lookingto invest in a sustainable, long-term energy sector witha ready market and significantly lower start-up costs then depleting energy exploration",0
1,But these new developments would also have another important advantage for the Middle East; a cleaner environment,0
1,The use of petroleum for electricity generation has made the Middle East's air quality one of the poorest in the world,0
4,Twenty-nine of the world's most polluted cities are in the MENA region,2
1,Recent energy challenges could have very costly consequences for the region,0
1,left unaddressed,0
1,they could also reap huge rewards,0
1,"met with robust energy reforms and additional investment in alternative energies,especially solar",0
1,And there are positive signs for the region,0
4,Saudi Arabia alone has announced a $109bn investment planto generate a third of its electricity,2
0,Qatar has also made solar energy agreements with major renewable energy companies as part of its commitments to the Solar GCC alliance,2
1,Howthese measures materialise over the next decade or soremainsto be seen,0
1,there is room for optimism,0
1,"the Middle East's unrivalled solar potential meansthat theoretically, it can become more then a just a world leader in fossil fuel production",0
1,it can become a world leader in renewable energy production as well,0
0,"It has been a few years since the sudden death of the Sun of the Nation, Marshal Kim Jong-ilwhich made his third son, Kim Jong-un, then in his late 20s, the supreme leader of North Korea",2
2,Three years is the length of the traditional mourning periodthat Koreans are supposedto observe after the death of their father or sovereign,2
1, now is the timeto make some observations about Kim's North Korea,0
1,"Whathas remained the same, andwhathas changed since December 2011?",0
1,The dawn of Kim's rule was marked by intense purges of his father's top dignitaries,0
0,"In December 2011, during his father's funeral, Kim walked next to his father's hearse in the company of three top generals and four top civilian officials",2
1,"Three years on, none of these people have their jobs",0
0,At least one of them was executed,2
0,whileall but one have disappeared without a trace,2
1,"Kim's decisionto arrest and execute Chang Song-taek, his aunt's husband,long the ""grey eminence"" of Pyongyang politics, was a dramatic signal to the elite",0
1,The sorry fate of Chang was meantto showthat nobody is immune from the wrath of the supreme leader,0
1,These purges were obviously necessaryto startchanging the country,0
1,sinceKim's policies will be very different from those of his father and grandfather,0
1,"So far, the most important changes can be seen in the field of economic management",0
1,"From late 2012, the North Korean government beganto implement reformswhich are remarkably similar towhatChina did in the early days of Deng Xiaoping, around 1980",0
1,"Farmers,who were hitherto government employees with a fixed salary,are now given a certain percentage of the harvest, and have predictably startedto feel motivated",0
1,"As a result, the food situation has improvedmarkedly",0
1,"In industry, a slow-motion switch from a Leninist, centrally planned economy to markets has been initiated as well",0
1,"The unofficial private economy, far more advanced in North Korea than most imagine, is now quietly encouraged",0
1,"There is no sign of relaxation in the political sphere, however",0
1,"Kim has launched a massive crackdown on illegal border movements,effectively closing North Korea's border with China ",0
1,which had remained porous for decades,0
1,"He has also done muchto root out the penchantthat many North Koreans have recently developed for smuggled foreign TV shows, especially South Korean soap operas and films",0
1,"Such concerns are not merely motivated by paranoia, regardless ofwhatthe international media says",0
1,"The supreme leader knowsthat his position is precarious,andthat tightening the screws of social control and surveillancemay helphim prolong his rule",0
1,North Korea under Kim remains as stubborn in its nuclear ambitionsasit was under his father,0
1,"Having seen the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the popular rebellion against Libya's Gaddafithat was indirectly assisted by western might,North Korean decision-makers have every reasonto wantto continueto advance their nuclear weapons potential",0
1, there has also been a truly unprecedented crisis in Sino- North Korean relations,0
0,"In the last years of Kim Jong-il, China was North Korea's major sponsor and trade partner",2
1,Now things are different,0
1,The Chinese and North Korean media (strictly controlled by the government in both countries) have exchanged thinly veiled verbal attacks,0
0,"whilethe Chinese government has frozen all Beijing-sponsored infrastructure projects in North Korea - including, for example, a new bridge over the Yalu River",2
1,"The North Korean government under Kim has shown hitherto unprecedented interest in foreign investment, as longasthis investment comes from sources other than China",0
1,"At present, the young marshal has pinned his hopes on Russia - currently itself on a collision course with the West",0
1,North Korean leaders obviously believethat Russia under Vladimir Putin will behavelikethe Soviet Union once didand shower North Korea with aid grants as a reward for Pyongyang's militant anti-Americanism,0
1,Such hopes are misplaced,0
1,it will take some timebeforePyongyang's decision-makers realise the sad truth,0
1,"There is little doubtthat Kim wantsto be popularand loved by his people, and perhaps sincerely cares about the wellbeing of the North Korean populace",0
1,thoughhe might have rather eccentric ideas onwhatconstitutes such wellbeing,0
0,"Under his watch, the North Korean government has spent a significant part of its meagre resources onbuilding all kinds of entertainment facilities, including an elite ski resort, a number of water parks and even a dolphinarium",2
1,Kim's North Korea is increasingly a place quite different from the North Korea of his father,0
1,"It is moving towards a more efficient economy, but also towards more internal repression",0
1,It is more prone to erratic changes in domestic policy and more eccentric in many regards,0
1,"for the foreseeable future it is goingto remain a nuclear and authoritarian regime, run by the Kim family and a small hereditary elite",0
1,"This is not negotiable, irrespectivelyof whatthe outside world thinks and does",0
1,No one in the United States is actually surprisedthat a grand jury in New York City decidednot to indict Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner,0
1,"In the same way that few Americans, regardless of political leanings were surprisedwhenOfficer Darren Wilson was not indicted forkilling Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, just over a week ago",0
1,"The proximity of these two rulings, and the subsequent protests and civil unrestthat have occurred in their wake, however,is an opportunity for President Barack Obamato make lasting and significant changes in the fundamental principles governing the US",0
1,The question will be doeshe have the political capitalto do it?,0
1,Garner was killed in July duringwhatwas an unpleasant.but fairly typical interaction between minorities and police in the US,0
0,"He was accused by local police of selling ""loosies"" or cigarettes in boxesthat hadn't been properly taxed",2
0,whenhe told the officersthat he wasn't selling them and was tired ofbeing harassed,2
1,the situation turned grim,0
0,He was quickly surrounded by several officers,2
0,Officer Pantaleo put Garner in a chokehold and helped force him down onto the ground,2
0,Garner screamedthat he couldn't breathe,2
0,despite his protests police continuedto hold his neckin orderto handcuff him,2
0,whenit became apparentthat he had stoppedbreathing,2
1,the four EMTs on the scene made no effortto revive him,0
0,This entire episode was caught on video by a friend of Garner's,2
0,its viral spread helped spurNew York authorities to actually convene a grand jury of 25 New York citizens,2
0,"The grand jury, however, decided that despite the visual evidence, and despite the city coronerdeclaring Garner's death a homicide,that there was not enough evidenceto warrant a full trial",2
0,Thousands of Americans of all ages and colours took to the streets in a series of spontaneous protests across the country,2
1,It's easy from the outsideto look at these protests and assumethat this is a dangerous and destabilising tipping point;that there is a new wave of violence against minoritiesthat has finally reached a point of no return,0
1,This is not entirely true,0
1,"Violence against minorities, either directly sanctioned by, or tacitly tolerated by the federal government is the norm in the US, not an anomaly",0
1,"From slavery to the massacre of Native Americans to rampant racial terrorism against African Americans, the US has not stopped its bloody relationship with violence and people of colour",0
4,WhileAfrican Americans only make up 13 percent of the population,2
4,they account for over 30 percent of all police killings in 2012 alone,2
1,"Whenyou combine this kind of history with racial discrimination in sentencing, arrests, fines, jail time",0
1,"whereAfrican Americans routinely receive longer, harsher and less lenient penalties than whites for the same crimes",0
1,"it is hardto simply saythat the cases of Eric Garner (or Michael Brown, or Tamir Rice or John Crawford) are new or isolated incidents",0
1,The US criminal justice system isn't broken,0
1,it's working exactly the wayit was intendedto work,0
1,"it was never written, implemented or designedto provide justice or equality for African Americans",0
1,whatis differentinthis case isthat it's not just African Americans protesting,0
0,"a significant number of white, Latino and Asian Americans have flooded the streets of New Yorkprotesting the Garner ruling, shutting down major highways, malls and even disrupting the annual Christmas tree lighting",2
1,"At its core, police violence is a white American problem, not a black one",0
1,"The only waythis tide of violence can be stemmedisifwhite Americanswho are angry about and stand against institutional racism and discrimination,are willingto directly confront white Americanswho still support the waythese institutions are run",0
1,Solutions to institutional racism and police violence can't be dropped off at the doors of African Americans any longer,0
1,the white American majority must take some responsibility,0
1,"Beyond that, it is time for the presidentto takebolder stepsto address systematic inequality in sentencingand policing across the US",0
1,President Obama has always been partialto piecemeal strategies,0
1,his rhetoric is often bold and sweeping,0
1,"the hostility of the Republican Congress, mixed with his own political personality, has often led to marginal policy changes",0
0,"On Monday, he convened a commission of civil rights leaders and unveiled plansto put more shoulder cameras on police officers' uniforms and thoroughly review Programme 1033",2
2,which allowslocal police departments to get free access to surplus military equipment,2
1,whilethose are fine first steps,0
1,neither would have saved Garner's life or changed the decision of the grand jury,0
0,The police did not have heavy militarised equipment,2
1,they employed a physical chokehold methodthat had been declared illegal by the New York police department for over 20 years,0
1,that too wasn't enoughto warrant a trial,0
2,Whileshoulder cameras are knownto limit cases of abuse and harassment,2
1,the Garner case showsthat they do not guaranteethe police will be heldaccountable,0
1,The only waythat the president can do something about these eventsandthe frustration felt by the publicisto actually demandthat the Department of Justice indict and conduct trials in some of these cases,0
1,"President Obama has no trouble prosecuting ""terrorists"" and ""whistle blowers"" or those deemedto have spied on the US",0
1,He could certainly bring the power of the federal governmentto investigate and indict cases of police violence,0
1,President Obama is not all powerful,0
1,he is certainly much more capablethanhe has shown thus far inacting on the issueshe feelsare priorities for the US,0
1,Obama truly wantsto establish a legacy beyond immigration and Obamacare,0
1,"he needsto make large spectacular displays ofinvestigating and indicting officerswho engage in misconduct, especially in casesthat result in the death of unarmed African Americans",0
1,he doesn't,0
1,"the worst part of his final two years as president won't just come from the Republican House and Senate, but from millions of Americans,most of whom voted for him,marching throughthe streets having lost faith in his abilityto lead",0
0,"In the light of the sad case of Leelah Alcorn, the Ohio transgender teenagerwho killed herself afterbeing forcedto undergo conversion therapy,I have been askedhowteenagers can deal with parentswho are completely unsupportive or hostile to their emerging independent identity",2

1,"Despite the terrible feelings of rejection a teenager might experience,one day they may be ableto understand their parents' point of view",0
1,they are strict and inflexible - unableto move with the times or accept anything other than their values,0

1,Could 2015 be the breakout year for the economy?,0
1,Last week we gotvery joyful news,0
1,All of this is good newsaswe ring in the new year,0
1,And the best may be yetto come,0
1,So whyis the economy finally shifting into a higher gear?,0
1,This isn't a story of government-directed growth or stimulus spending,0
1,It's the opposite,0
1,Washington's role in the economy is startingto shrink after years of Obama administration activism,0
1,The private sector is startingto take over,0
4,"The growth was propelled by a big rise in business investment, up nearly 9 percent; personal consumption, up 3.2 percent; and exports, up 4.5 percent",2
4,"Government spending,which is a negative for the economy,grew by 4.4 percent, thanks to a big rise in military spending",2
1,domestic spending is still restrained,0
1,The news was so goodthat even the threatthat the Fed will now have an excuseto raise interest rateshasn't deterred the bulls on Wall Street,0
3,Here is the case for optimism going forward,1
1, a huge factor in the economic rebound has been the fall in energy costs,0
0,"Asthe price of oil has fallen from $105 a barrel this summerto closer $70 by September,(and at the end of Decemberit was at $53)the cost of oil imports has tumbled",2
4,Imports fell by nearly 2 percent,2
4,this alone added almost 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth,2
1,Even that greatly understates the economic windfall from cheap energy,0
2,Production costs fallwhenenergy costs do,2
1,"the supply of American-produced non-oil and gas products, such as manufactured goods, riseswhengas is cheap",0
1,Gas prices should continueto fall,0
1,the good-news story rolls on,0
1,the addition to GDP from energy should be even higher,0
3,"Thank you, Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota",1
3,"And thank you,fracking",1
1,businesses are clearly feeling less trepidation about investing,0
1,"some of the wet blanket of Obama's anti-business, anti-shareholder agenda has dissipatedasthe Republican Congress repels his worst ideas: cap-and-trade, minimum wage hikes, new taxes on the energy industry and massive new spending initiatives out of Washington",0
1,"Gridlock now looksto be built into the political system for the next two years, and in many waysthat's reassuring",0
1, government spending has fallen a lot morethanpeople think,0
1,"Despite the boost in military spending in the last quarter, the biggest story of the U.S  economy over the last three years has been the retrenchment of government spending",0
4,Federal spending has fallen from 24.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 23.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 21 percent of GDP in 2014,2
4,"Even better news isthat in the fourth quarter of 2014, federal spending as a share of GDP fell to below 20 percent, according to a new analysis by Dan Clifton of Strategas, an economic policy consulting firm",2
1,"This is creating an anti-Keynesian boost to growth,becausethe government is taking fewer private sector resources each month",0
1,The 4 percentage points less of GDPthat the government is spendingmeans4 percent more GDP for private businesses and familiesto spend,0
1,That's close to $700 billion a year more for private investment and construction and spending,0
1,"This, by the way, shows the foolhardiness of the Keynesian notion of a government-spending free lunch",0
0,Five years ago the Obama economics team was talking about multiplier effects from higher federal outlays --the stimulus bill spent $830 billion--that would juice the economy with even more private spending,2
1,It never happened,0
4,Even President Obama's own economic analysis foundthe economy grew more slowlythanit would have without the government debt- financed spending,2
1,The real effect of government spending is to crowd out private spending,0
1,A final reason for optimism isthat the incoming class of Republican governors and conservative state legislators across the country should mean more growth policiescoming out of state capitals,0
1,At least a dozen governors from Massachusetts to Illinois to Tennessee are talking about tax cutsto create jobs,0
1,we don't get tax reform at the federal level,0
1,states should be providing an additional tax cut stimulus,0
1,"Skeptics will saythat Obama's executive actions on climate change, immigration, energy policy and so on will continueto be a restraint on growth",0
1,That's for sure,0
1,This recovery from recession is still nearly $2 trillion behindwherewe should would beifwe had a Reagan-paced boom,0
1,This is still one of the most anemic recoveries,0
1,thoughit is belatedly picking up steam,0
1,It's also truethat wages are still flat for most workers,0
1,the big challenge for the economy is raising productivitysoAmericans get a well-deserved pay raise,0
1,"As2014 comes to a close,here'swherewe are",0
4,Interest rates are as lowasthey've been in 40 years,2
1,"inflation is tame, thanks to the surge in oil and gas output",0
1,corporate profits remain high,0
1,"The rest of the world economy, from Germany to Japan to Russia, is a debacle",0
1,But that's all the more reasonto bet on the USA in 2015,0
1," no, Mr  President, you didn't build that",0
1,Thosewho don't votedon't get,0
1,The young vote least and they get least,0
1,the old voters are showered with blessings by the Cameron government,0
4,New research from the House of Commons library showswomen are voting less and less: 9.1 million women failedto vote last timeand at each election the gap between women and menvoters has grownwider,2

1,The announcement of a new era of relations between the United States and Cuba came as a surprise to manywho follow and study the relationship between the two rivals,0
1,"The old guard of Cuban exiles, led by Senator Marco Rubio, predictably reacted with their usual anger",0
1,"By contrast, many second generation Cuban Americans and advocates reacted differently - with optimism and hope for change",0
1,"It is importantto understand those reactions to the recent announcement as part of a broader evolution towards new relations between the US and Cuba over 20 years in the making, following fundamental security, economic, and political changes",0
1,"The end of the Cold War in 1989 spelled change for Latin America,just asit did for the world",0
1,"For Cuba, it meant the loss of its biggest sponsor",0
1,"which plunged the island into a five-year economic tailspin, contracted its GDP by 30 to 45 percent, and precipitated a number of changes to Cuban policy and law",0
1,"Those reforms have accelerated throughout the last decade, including an ongoing planto unify the island's dual currency",0
1,Cuba has had no choice but to liberalise portions of its economy,0
1,European countries have been ableto take advantage of those opportunities,0
1,"In the last two decades, a Cuban economy starved for growth has looked overseas and seenthe island more willingto come to agreement regarding foreign presence",0
1,"The implications of the fall of the Soviet Union were not only economic in nature, but also resulted in a shift in US policy towards Latin America more broadly",0
1,"In the 20-plus years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the US has tolerated, or even openly collaborated with,leftist regimes in Venezuela, Bolivia, and Hondurasthat in another era would have been deliberately undermined, or perhaps overthrown, as in the cases of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua",0
1,The strategic and military calculus of our relationship with Cuba has fundamentally changed,0
1,Presidents and Congress no longer have the blanket justification of Cuba as a military threatasthey did during the Cold War,0
1,"For Cuban exiles, 1989 was not so much a watershed moment as an opportunityto continueapplying pressure to a failing regime",0
0,The Cuban-American lobby continuedto promote isolationism,2
1,believingthat this post-Soviet moment was finally the chanceto see a democratic counterrevolution on the island,0
1,This beliefthat isolation would force the collapse of Castro regimerestrictedpolicy responses available to the US government and presidential administrations,0
1,Changes in the global economic and political relationship with Cuba did not affect US policy,0
1,"andCuba, for the most part, was excluded from the more moderate and tolerant US foreign policy towards Latin America",0
1,Republican presidents and legislators provedto be more punitive towards the island,0
1,particularly given their reliance on the Cuban-American lobby for monetary and electoral support in south Florida,0
0,"Despite a cooling in relations during the late 1990s, due to the shooting down of the two US planes flown by ""Brothers to the Rescue"", President Bill Clinton eased restrictions on humanitarian aid, broadened the abilityto send remittances,increased allowable person-to-person interactions, and resumed direct flights between the countries",2
1,"President Clinton's actions were part of a broader government strategy of ""constructive engagement""",0
1,"in which the US would actively engage with the Cuban people, but maintain pressure on the government",0
1,"The new millennium did not bring significant changes in relations as, true to Republican form,President George W Bush maintained the status quo of ""constructive engagement""",0
1,"his administration took a harder line, at times including Cuba in the same paragraph as the ""Axis of Evil""",0
1,"President Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and conservative Cuban- American legislators continuedto push a hard line on Cuba",0
1,the profile of the average Cuban American changed,0
1,"The stereotypical conservative Cuban - still upset, and rightfully so, over the nationalisation of private property and human rights abuses during the revolution - still attemptsto dominate political discourse",0
1,a new face of the Cuban American has emerged,0
1,"young, second-generation children have come of age with the desireto see for themselves the homelandthat they have only heard about in stories",0
1,"new, post-1989 migrants,who are economic rather than political refugees,have closer personal ties to the island",0
1,The election of President Obama and the nomination of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State signalled a new era with a renewed focus on diplomacy,0
1,"Four months aftertaking office,the administration quietly continuedto liberalise relations between the US and Cuba",0
1, Alan Gross' imprisonment in 2009 gave opportunity for the age-old arguments against Cubato resurface,0
1,with the old guard claimingthat nothing had changedand seeing it as the latest example of the long history of Cuban aggression,0
1,"I do not dispute the factthat the Castro brothers have been harsh dictatorsandthat their system of government has deeply damaged multiple generations of Cubans, nor doI disputethat regime change should still be a goal of US policy",0
1,"However asmy analysis has shown,the rest of the story has changed",0
1,Cuba's economy continuesto search for growth,0
1,the government is actively looking outside the country for investment,0
1,Long gone are the existential security threatsthat came from the island during the Cold War,0
1, this reflects the changing opinions of Cuban Americans,0
1,"The new modes of engagement announced by Obama on December 17 were not an acknowledgement of defeat,butan effort for a new way forward that reflects those changes",0
1,December 17 will no doubt be an important moment in the lives of Cubans and Cuban Americans,0
1,it deserves more analysis than the knee-jerk reactions on the front pages of newspapers and talk shows in the US,0
1,Obama should be commended for basing policy on facts rather than emotions,0
1,"The US must continueto actively engage with the island,lestwe losethe opportunity to influence a neighbourthat is gradually rejoining the regional and world economy and political order",0
2,"Mary, the mother of Jesus, features prominently in our Christmas celebrations",2
1,"Christmas carols, greeting cards and nativity reenactments all celebrate the important roleshe played in the birth of the Messiah",0
1,But what about Joseph?,0
1,Whatdoes the Christmas story say about the role of fathers?,0
1,"The Gospel of Matthew, written in the second half of the first century to a predominantly Jewish audience, places Joseph at the center of the birth of Christ",0
1,Complimentary to the Gospel of Lukewheremost of the activity centers on Mary,0
5,Matthew reportsthat it is Josephthat is instructed by an angel in a dreamnot to call off his impending marriage to Mary,2
1,"Joseph is pictured as a decisive leader, protector and provider for his family in this Gospel",0
1,"The birth narratives of Jesus in Matthew, not only highlights the importance of family as the building block of a stable society, but also communicates the importance of fathers in the raising of children",0
1,"With Joseph as our example, four lessons for fathers can be taken from this Christmas story",0
1,to be a fatheris not just a biological description,0
0,"Joseph was not the physical father of Jesus,butasinstructed by the angeltook Mary as his wife and provided a home for Jesus",2
1,Being a fatheris a matter of the heart,0
1,Joseph is a great role model for those fathersthat have chosento raise non-biological children as their own,0
1,Fathers create homes for children byenlarging their hearts and providing a safe and nurturing environment for them,0
1, fathers model good values to their children,0
0,Matthew callsJoseph a just man,2
1,This is in sharp contrast to the wicked Herod in the same Gospel,0
0,who kills numerous boys in his narcissistic rageashe attemptsto remove the pending threat of the birth of the King of the Jews,2
1,We are inundated with so many painful recollections of fathersthat did not match the expectations of their children,0
1,Good fathers embody the moral and hopeful ideals of their children,0
1,They model the way,0
1, fathers do all in their powerto protect their family,0
0,"Joseph, warned in a dream about the murderous plans of Herod, moves his family to the safety of Egypt",2
1,This selfless act of Joseph illustrateswhatgood fathers do best,0
1,they place the interest of their families above their own,0
1,"Lastly, fathers provide a future for their children",0
0,"Once again, Matthew recordsthat Joseph inreturning from Egyptscanned the environment and decidedto move Jesus and Mary to Galilee, far from the watchful eye of Archelaus, the rulerthat succeeded Herod",2
1,Good fathers recognizethat fathering does not endwhenchildren turn of age,0
1,Fathers consider the future of their children beyond their own mortality and workto provide a prosperous and successful future for them,0
1,Perhaps the time has cometo reconsider the role of Joseph in our celebration of Christmas,0
1,"May we rediscover not only his good example, but the stabilizing and transformative effectthat good fathers have on children, families and societies",0
5,"During a radio interview this week, French President Francois Hollande saidRussian President Vladimir Putin ""doesn't wantto annex eastern Ukraine -he toldme that""",2

1,Russian weapons and equipment are still pouring into eastern Ukraine,0
0,"As recently as last November, NATO confirmed another build-up of Russian military equipment and troops inside Ukraine",2
1,"In light of Russia's recent behaviour, whatcan be expected in eastern Ukraine in 2015?",0
1,Predictions of this sort are almost impossible and are usually invariably wrong,0
1, it is possibleto develop various scenariosthat could offer a glimpse intowhatRussia's plans might be,0
1,Russia's ultimate goal isto keep Ukraine out of the transatlantic community - the EU and NATO,0
1,Russia will also wantto consolidate the gains made by separatist forces in eastern Ukraine,0
1,"To this end, Russia will have short-term and long term goals",0
1,"The primary short-term goal for Russia in Ukraine will beto keep the conflict ineasternUkraine ""frozen""",0
1,"meaningthat whilethe bullets might stopflying,there will be no real effortto bring a conclusive end to the conflict",0
1,This equates to victory for Moscow and defeat for Kiev,0
1,it leaves Ukraine not in control of all its territory,0
1,"Russia can also use the ""frozen"" status of separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as bargaining chips in future talks with the West on other issues",0
1,"In terms of Russia's longer term goals in Ukraine for 2015 and beyond, there are a number of scenariosthat can play out",0
1,It is safeto assumethat Moscow will helpthe separatists consolidate gains in Donetsk and Luhanskto create a political entitythat becomes more like a viable state,0
1,"This will be no easy task and will require the capture of important communication and transit nodes, such as Donetsk airport, the city of Mariupol and its port, and the Luhansk power plant",0
1,These are still under Ukrainian government control but are all neededifthe separatists wantto achieve true autonomy,0
1,A more ambitious scenario might seeRussia expanding separatist-controlled areasto include the entire eastern region of Ukraine consisting of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and the eastern sections of Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv oblasts,0
1,This would require capturing Kharkiv,0
2,which is Ukraine's second largest city,2
1,Kharkiv also holds a certain degree of symbolism for those in Moscow dreaming of the days of Soviet glory,0
0,it was the first city in Ukraineto recognise the Bolshevik takeover in 1917,2
1,The most aggressive scenario might see Moscow attemptingto re-establish control of the historical Novorossiya region in modern-day southern Ukraine,0
1,This would create a land bridge between Russia and Crimea ,0
1,"eventually linking up with the Russian-backed Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova",0
1,"This would be no easy undertaking and would require the capture of the heavily defended cities of Mariupol and Odessa, Ukraine's tenth-largest and third- largest cities, respectively",0
1,Russia is desperateto establish a land bridge to Crimea,0
1,the cost ofproviding goods and services by sea and air to the peninsulais becoming prohibitively expensive,0
0, Putin has ordered a bridge linking the Russian mainland with Crimeato be built by 2018,2
1,"With an economy in recession, the collapse of the rouble, and the low price of oil,finding the $5.2bn requiredto build the bridgemight not be possible",0
1, Russia could be forced intocreating a land bridge to Crimea,0
1,"Out of all of Russia's previous leaders, Putin has more in common with Russia's imperial czarsthanhe does with the Soviet premiers",0
1,Perhaps Putin has most in common with Emperor Nicolas I,0
0,who ruled Russia between 1825 and 1855,2
0,"Nicolas I's reign was marked by a stagnate economy, territorial expansions in the Caucasus, the crushing of political dissent, and a war in Crimea",2
0,"In the case of Nicolas I, his war in Crimea was disastrous and could have had serious implications for his ruleifhe had not died from pneumoniabeforethe war ended",2
1,Will Crimea prove the same for Putin today?,0
1,Only time will tell,0
1,One thing is for certain,0
1,"Russia's designs on eastern Ukraine are far from over, 2015will proveto be a very interesting year",0
0,"Whenthe news arrived from the White House on Tuesdaythat Barack Obama would veto the GOP's Keystone pipeline bill- or at least ""thatthe president would not sign this bill""asis",2

1,Keystone's not dead yet,0
1,feckless Democrats in the Congress could make some kind of deal later this month or later this year,0
1,the president could still yield down the road to the endlessly corrupt State Department bureaucracythat continuesto push the pipeline,0
1,it's pretty amazingto seewhathappenswhenpeople organize,0
1,"The fight against the XL pipeline began with indigenous people in Canada, and spread to ranchers along the pipeline route in places like Nebraska",0
0,"And then, in the spring of 2011,whenthe climate scientist Jim Hansen pointed out the huge pool of carbon in the Canadian tar sands",2
0,the fight spread to those of us in the nascent climate movement,2
1,We had no real hope ofstopping Keystone,0
1,"asthe National Journal poll indicated,this seemed the most done of deals",0
1,we also had no real choice butto try,0
1,"And so people went to jail in larger numbersthanthey had for many years, and wrote more emails to the Senate than on pretty much any issue in history, and made more public comments to the government than on any infrastructure project in history",0
1,And all that effort didn't just tie up this one pipeline in knots,0
0,"It also scared investors enoughthat they shut down three huge planned new tar-sands mines, taking $17bn in capital and millions of tons of potential emissions off the table",2
1,"And it helped embolden peopleto fight every other pipeline, and coal port, and frack field, and coal mine",0
1,The Keystone fights helped spur a full-on fossil-fuel resistancethat now mounts a powerful challenge to the entire fossil-fuel industry at every single turn,0
1,It's notas ifwe're winning the climate fight,0
1,the planet's temperature keepsrising,0
1,But we're not losing it the waywe used to,0
1,the president sticks to his word,0
1,this will be the first major fossil-fuel project ever shut down because of its effect on the climate,0
1,The IOUthat the president and the Chinese wrote in November about future carbon emissionsis a nice piece of paperthat hopefully will do great things in the decades ahead,0
1,the Keystone denial is cash on the barrelhead,0
1,It's actually keeping some carbon in the ground,0
1,The fossil-fuel industry's aura of invincibility is gone,0
1,They've got all the money on the planet,0

1,"Even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Palestinian Authority's just-thwarted attempt at a UN Security Council resolution was a spectacular waste of time, and needlessly handed Israel a symbolic diplomatic victory",0

1,"Draft resolutions are usually preceded by consultations with Council members, sowhoeversubmitsthem knows, beforehand,which waythe vote will go",0
1,This draft was no different,0
1, insufficient support among Council members was the initial reason given months ago by the PA for a delay in the vote,0
1,"As such, it must have known prior topresenting the draftthat it would fail",0
1,whygo through with it?,0
1, whydid the PA tryto push through a resolution in the first place?,0
1,it mustered the minimum votes,0
1,the US would have used its veto,0
1,the PA knew it,0
1,Not onlyhavethe Americans consistently scupperedany resolutionthat places even the slightest criticism or pressure on Israel,0
1,Washington had been explicit about its intentionto useits veto this time round if necessary,0
1,"As such, it is puzzlingthat Jordan's UN Ambassador Dina Kawar,whose countrysubmitted the draft with the backing of the PA and the Arab League,saidshe thoughtCouncil members should have had more timeto discuss the proposal",0
1,Whatwould be the point in the face of an assured American veto?,0
1,The only wayWashington would acquiescewasifthe resolution called for an end to the Palestinian occupation of Israel,0
1,This makes PA President Mahmoud Abbas's recent statementthat he had repeatedly postponedthe resolution due to US pressure equally puzzling,0
1,"Did he actually think anythinghe could say or dowould lead to the USdropping such pressure,orthat it would accept the draftthat was presented?",0
1,"In any case, months of consultations and various reasons for delays only resulted in the continued watering down of the text",0
1,"This led to widespread Palestinian condemnation, from the public and from every faction",0
1,Among the most prominent critics is the widely popular senior Fatah figure Marwan Barghouti,0
1,whose partydominates the PA and includes Abbas,0
5,"Barghouti described the text as an ""unjustified fallbackwhich will adversely affect the Palestinian position""",2
0, the draft was not put forward as a Chapter VII resolution,2

1, the draft did not contain any wordingthat would causeIsrael to worry,0
1,Giventhat the US veto shields Israel,0
1,that existing resolutions are ignored with impunity,0
1,it is astoundingthat the PA had any faith left in the Councilto attempt its latest futile exercise at statehood,0
1,the response of its UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour was telling in this regard,0
5,"""The Security Council has once again failedto uphold its charter dutiesto address this crises and to meaningfully contribute to a lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions.""",2
1,It has long been clearthat the UN is a highly unlikely place for Palestiniansto seek justice,0

1,It seemsthe mere mention of Israel automatically triggers an American veto,0
1,This whole months-long affair was an obvious exercise in futility,0

1,"These are the same terroriststhat today have beheaded Christians, Westerners and, just this past weekend, another American citizen",0
3,Think back to the days after September 11,1
1,We were blind about Al Qaeda,0
1,Most Americans fearedanother attack was imminent,0
1,And the best legal advice in government saidCIA actions to getthat information were legal,0
1,So CIA officers didwhatthey thought necessaryto protect Americans,0
1,A decade later we're suddenly castigating them for it,0
1, the report concludesthat the intelligence gathered from CIA's actions wasn't effective,0

1,"The plummeting oil prices have had negative consequences on economies across the world, from Moscow to Caracas to Tehran",0
1,The situation is particularly bad in Russia,0
1,wherethe shock of shrinking energy revenue is doubled by a monetary crisis,0
4,Just in the past week the Russian rouble lost 17 percent of its value in two days,2
4,its exchange rate to the US dollar has collapsed by over 50 percent since the beginning of the year,2
1,The energy crisis has its origin in a global surplus of crude oil supply resulting from a rapid expansion of oil production in the US,0
1,"In orderto dissuade additional investments in production of shale oil and tar sands in North America, and wedge a war on market shares,Saudi Arabia has voluntarily gone far above its previous OPEC production commitment",0
1,Some have seen this move as a plot by the Americansto punish countries like Iran and Russia,0
0, the sharp decrease in oil prices to $60 per barrel is far below the breakeven point for countries such as Venezuela and Iran,2
1,who need$140 per barrel to balance their budget and continue with their policies of social spending and subsidised imports of vital goods,0
1,The Russian economy is also very vulnerable to such price fluctuations,0
4,the energy sector accounts for about half of the state's revenues and a quarter of its gross domestic product,2
1,Putin's gambleto assumethat the West would not confront him over Ukraine because of energy security concernswas a miscalculation of the forces at play,0
1,The shrinking oil revenues coupled with the economic sanction packages have destroyed investors' confidence in the Russian economy,0
1,resulting in record levels of capital flight and a plunging rouble,0
4,According to the Russian ministry of economic developmentfood prices in Russia will increase by 12 percent by the end of this year,2
4,conservative estimates for the first months of 2015 already set inflation at 10 percent,2

1,the use of the Northern Sea Route offers military advantages as well,0
1,Russia's interests in the Arctic go beyond the economic and military advantages offered by the Northern Sea Route,0
0,"The region is rich in minerals, wildlife, fish, and other natural resources",2
4,Some estimates claimthat 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and almost one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas reserves are located in the Arctic region,2
0,The majority of these untapped resources are also in areasto which Russia lays claim,2
1,the Arctic region is an area of low conflict,0
1,it is in everyone's interestto keepit that way,0
1,Althoughthe security challenges currently faced in the Arctic are not military in nature,0
1,there is still a requirement for military capability in the regionthat can support civilian authorities,0
0, civilian search and rescue and natural disaster response - in such an unforgiving environment as the Arctic - can be augmented by the military,2
1,"So it should be no surprisethat like Russia, other Arctic countries deploy military assets into the region",0
1,"Even so, Russia has taken stepsto increase military capability in the regionthat seemsto be beyond the scope ofsupporting civilian operations",0
1,One must consider the implications of Russia's increased military presence in the region in light of Moscow's recent aggression against Ukraine,0

1,"Russian activity in the Arctic,whethermilitary, economic or scientific,harks back to images of Peter the Great and the Great Northern Expedition in the 18th century",0
1,This helps Putin with his dream ofbringing Russia back to its former imperial glory,0
1,"It is Russia's prerogativeto place military assets inside its national territory, however,these actions should be of concern to others in the region",0

1,But much less media attention -- especially from the black civil rights leadership -- has gone to the deadly assault on a white man by three black teenage boys in St  Louis,0
1,which is likelyto end with adult murder convictions and life sentences for the boys,0
1,"That sentence equalsa long, slow death in jail just as final and awful as Michael Brown's fate",0
5,"St  Louis police and politicians saythere was nothing racial about the attack on Zemir Begic, 32, a Bosnian immigrant",2
5,They sayit was not a hate crime aimed at Bosnians,2
5,And they sayit had nothingto do with the racial crisis in Ferguson over Brown's death,2
1,"Yes, it did",0
1,Black men have the highest rate of conviction for violent crime of any racial group in the country,0
1,"The harsh truth isthat we're really talking about poor, young Black men",0
1,"In any case, Blacks have the highest dropout and unemployment rates",0
1,Black children have the highest poverty rate of any group of children,0
1,Poor black boys too often take their fashion and cultural cues from rap musicthat celebrates criminal behavior as a show of power and rebellion,0
1,"Often, the result is a thuggish attitude, includingdressing likeconvicts with their pants falling downbecausethe jail guards have taken away their belts",0
1,"Another consequence of civil rights leaders' failureto challenge criminal behavior in black neighborhoodsis the angry, defiant interactions between those black teenagers and the police",0
1,"Oncethe black violence leads to death, especiallyifit is beyond the streets of a poor black neighborhood,there is no mercy",0
1,"The broken justice systemthat gives police a pass forkilling an unarmed black teenis hard evidencethat Americans, middle-class blacks and whites, thinkclassifying young black menasan ongoing threat to public safety is not racial stereotyping",0
1,"And the police and grand jurors see physically large black men -- in the cases of both Michael Brown and New York's Eric Garner,who was choked to death by police-- as especially threatening",0

1,Mandatory body cameras for police are a good idea,0
1,"they are not a panacea for the troubled relationship between the larger society and the broken black families, the poorly educated black children and the steady violence in poor black American communities",0
0,Recallthat Garner's death at the hands of the police is on videotape,2
0,it made no difference in the grand jury's decisionnot to indict the police,2
1,"Even with the video,whatthe prosecutor and the grand jurors sawinGarner was not a fellow citizen being hurt,but a troubling social reality",0
1,They saw a potential threat to themselves in a big black man hustling on the street,0

1,It begins withacting out in defiance of a larger societythat ignores them,0
1,Sometimes there are displays of angerthat are seen asthreatening,0
1,they end upkilling each other,0
1,Other times there are confrontations with the policethat end with the boys in jail or the grave,0
1,"Robert Joseph Mitchell, the 17-year-old charged with first-degree murder in the attack on Begic, looksto fit in that group of poor, young black men in the ""pipeline"" to prison",0

1,"his story is one more tragic version of""I can't breathe.""",0
1,"No matterwhose sideyou are on in the upheaval following the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri,everyone should agree on the profound sadness of it all: sadnessthat an 18-year-old boy-man walked a paththat led to his destruction;sadnessthat a police officer felt the needto defend himself byshooting another human being;sadness over the rioting and lootingthat followed a grand jury's decisionnot to indict Officer Wilson;and for some, sadnessthat Wilson was not indicted",0
0,Much of the sadness was encapsulated in a sound biteI saw on one TV network,2
5,"An African-American business owner, surveying the destruction of his store, plaintively asked,""Howam I goingto feed my kids?""",2
1,I have an answer,0
1,"it is onethat should be applied to anyoneconvicted of riotous behavior, destruction of property and looting",0
1,It's called restitution,0
1,"Restitution is an Old Testament concept institutedto remind peoplethat whenone harms another person, or steals or destroys property,someone else suffers and deserves reimbursement",0
1,It saysthe state is less a debtor than the victim of a crime,0
1,Restitution can also instill true moral guilt in a person,0
1,which can lead to genuine repentance and a decision by the perpetratorto make different choices leading to a better life,0
1,"the authorities in Ferguson examine videosthat show the faces of many of the rioters and looters,charges will undoubtedly be filed",0
1,convicted,0
1,the perpetrators should be forcedto pay for the damagethey caused,0
1,they have jobs,0
1,",their paychecks should be garnished",0
1,they are on welfare,0
1,",those checks should be forwarded to the businessesthey destroyed",0
1,they receive food-purchasing assistance,0
1,that assistance should be withdrawn,0
1,This should be the practice going forward,0
1,Thosewho destroytheir communities will be requiredto pay back those harmed by their hooliganism and forfeit any governmentbenefitsthey receive,0
1,This might require legislation,0
1,politicians should have the public's support,0
1,A close relative of restitution is shaming,0
1,The convicted should be brought before those harmed by their behavior and publicly shamed,0
1,No one seemsto be ashamed of anything nowadays,0
1,shaming might help prevent future violence,0
1,Rioters and looterswho are blackcould be shamed by law-abiding African-Americans,0

1,"Don't you owethem something betterthan this?""",0
1,"Perhaps ifpeople realizethat their destructive behavior will cost them something,they thinkmight twice about harming others and robbing them of a living",0
1,People from around the country are reportedly donating moneyto help thosewhose businesseswere destroyed,0
1,That again demonstrates the generosity of Americans of all races and backgrounds,0
1,"donations will help, along with insurance",0
1,it covers damage caused by violent protesters,0
1,the lawbreakers should still be requiredto take responsibility for their actions,0
1,"In additionto whateverlegal penalties might result,restitution and shaming should be part of the punishment",0
1,"We've gotten away from personal responsibility and accountability,preferring insteadto cast lawbreakers as ""victims,""",0
1,whenthe true victims are often ignored,0
1,Too often many blame others for their circumstances,0

1,The news of the Guantanamo detainees' arrival to Uruguay received impressive coverage in international media,0
0,Uruguay is the second Latin American countryto accept Guantanamo detainees,2
0,"the first one was El Salvador,which welcomed two Chinese nationals in 2012",2
1,"The factthat there have been only two countries in Latin America accepting Guantanamo inmatesis already particularly extraordinary, given US historical ascendancy on the region",0
0,"Even US' main allies in the region, Chile and Colombia, rejected US proposalsto accept prisoners from Guantanamo,consideringthe move highly unpopular",2
1,"Perhaps the spotlight fell on Uruguay as a Guantanamo detainee host because of Mujica's own media popularity over his unusually humble way of life as a world leader, and his progressive public speeches and political agenda",0
1,He also managedto get a lot of media attention over the arrival of around forty Syrian refugees in October,0
4,althoughthey were few in number compared to the thousands of refugeesthat neighbouring countries such as Brazil and Argentina have been accepting,2
0,"The day the detainees landed in Montevideo,Mujica sent an open letter to Uruguayans and Barack Obama",2
0,"The first sentence reads,""Solidarity is the tenderness of the people"",a quote from Pablo Neruda referring to the 1939 exodus of Spanish Republicansescaping fascism to South America",2
1,Neruda's words well reflect the main humanitarian goal of the operation,0
1,which aimstoto reinforce the image of Uruguay as a peacemaker and international reference for humanitarian issues,0
1,"""Pepe"" has the aspiration, beforeceding power to Tabare Vazquez at the beginning of 2015,to spread his humanitarian legacy and reinforce his world reputation",0
1,"Through the well-publicised gesture, Mujica aimsto give hope to all those disenchanted peoplewho still thinkthat idealism and ethics in politics are still possible",0
1,"From a political perspective, Mujica's usual anti-imperialist stance leftmany in Uruguay astonishedthat he was willingto do a ""favour"" to Obama and accept the Guantanamo detainees",0
1,It is only in the second part of his open letterthat his political goals become apparent,0
0,"Mujica asks, as a gesture of reconciliation for all the American people, for the release of a 70 years-old Puerto Rican independence fighter, along with three Cuban detaineeswho are part of the group known as the Cuban Five",2
0,whose controversial detention in the late 1990sled to a worldwide campaign for their release,2
0,"He also asks for the lifting of the ""unjust embargo"" imposed on ""our sister"" Cuba",2
1,"Mujica's plea is reflective of an emerging regional bloc different than the usual ""left-leaning"" one",0
1,It is instead a heterogeneous regional political bloc ableto come to terms with ideological differences and to find common ground for regional coexistence in the name of progress,0
0,"Best example of this is the ongoing peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government in Cuba, with the participation of Chile and Venezuela",2
1,"Mujica's move, therefore, is not unprecedented",0
0,Back in 2009 the late Hugo Chavez hinted at the possibility ofaccepting Guantanamo detainees in Venezuelaand atraising the issue of Cuba's isoluation,2
1,"Cuba's reintegration into regional life, after decades of US ostracism, represents the main political goal of the bloc and of Mujica humanitarian operation",0
1," it is not surprisethat Jose Miguel Insulza, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) publicly lauded Mujica's move",0
1,"Althoughleftist American governments have been particularly at odds with the Washington-based regional organisation, as consequence of the informal exclusion of Cuba under US pressure",0
1,Insulza has been working hardto reverse it,0
0,"Just recently, he saidthat he hopedboth Cuba and the US would attend the next OAS summit planned for April in Panama City",2
1,The US is unlikelyto release the Cuban political prisoners,0
1,Cuba's unilateral release of Alan Gross after 5 years could be part of a larger swap following Mujica's move,0
1,The six Guantanamo detainees will probably be the last onesto be resettled in the region,0
1,"their landing in Montevideo madeit clearthat Latin America is not,andwill not be again the US backyard",0

2,"They are social animalswho liketo hang out in groups, preen and communicate with each other via display and call",2
2,Sitting in a cage for a few weeks being force-fedis a horrible fate for any sentient being,2
1,it is particularly nasty for these migratory birds,0
1,Some foie gras lovers arguethat gavage can be ethical,0
1,"there are ""good"" poultry farmerswho useflexible plastic tubes instead of steel to force feed birdswho getto roam around barns",0
5,"Anthony Bourdain famously commentedthat ""you see worse [than gavage] in the pay-per-view film on the hotel channel- andthat's people, for God's sake""",2
1,(Presumably he was referring to fellatio),0
1,"Then there's the ""civilized"" cultures argument: the ancient Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans used gavageto produce foie gras, therefore as a similarly ""civilized"" culturewe should be similarly allowedto force feed birds",0
1,"Possibly the most specious argument against the California ban came from the plaintiffs' lawyer, Michael Tenenbaum",0
5,"who called the ruling "" a victory for freedom.""",2
1,Tenenbaum wasn't ad-libbing,0
1,"many chefs and foodies have heldthat banning foie grasis the equivalent to ""cultural imperialism"" and is an abridgment of their basic rights",0
1,"Tenenbaum, too, truly believesthat",0
1,",he should be litigating for chefs' rightsto make shark fin soupfry up songbirds,pour boiling oil into live monkeys' brains,andin general cook up anything they damn well please",0
1,"I get nervouswhenpeople - even really smart, talented people - usethe word ""freedom"" to mean""I getto dowhatI want""",0
1,"In the case of foie gras bans, the argument is that,becausethis food is so delicious,you getto eat it, cook with it, produce it and make money off it",0
1,- no matterthat it's produced as the result of an inhumane practice,0
1,"which has been documented by scientists ascausing severe, prolonged suffering to animals",0
5,"The discontent of civilization,asFreud once pointed out,isthat we don't all getto dowhatwe want",2

5,"In a letter to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Syria's foreign ministry claimedthe bombing happenedto distract from the break up of Netanyahu's coalition",2
5,"Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman sayinghe would not comment on the ""foreign reports""",2
1,Syrian state media should always be read with a healthy pinch of salt,0
1,confirmed,0
1,the latest Israeli attack comes in a seriesthat preceded the outbreak of civil war,0
1,There is a certain format to this low level state of eternal conflict between the two parties,0
0,Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time,2
1,"Following the attacks,Syria responded with bombastic rhetoric overwhatit would do in the face of the strikes",0
1,nothing ever happened,0
1,"Since the Syrian uprising and civil war, Israel's primary concern has been with certain types of hi-tech weaponry going to Hezbollah",0
0,which was usedto explain strikes in January and May of 2013,2

0,aftershells were fired at their positions on the Golan Heights,2
0,"Syria responded to the January bombings by warning of a ""surprise""",2
1,in fact their actual reaction has been predictably mute,0
1,The airspace over Syria has never been busier with different nationspursuing different enemies with metrics of successhardto distinguish among the smoke and debris of the destruction,0
1,"This weekend's attacks,ifthey are eventually claimed by Israel,would further entrench the growing irrelevance of many of the region's borders as recognised and respected lines",0
0,the focus of global attention has been on ISIL's dismantling of the Iraq-Syria border,2
1,the Lebanon-Syria border is also becoming functionally blurred and clearly no longer deters Israel's strategic decision makers,0
1,"At the most immediate level, the strikes will likely emboldenAssad to play a traditional nationalist cardto strengthen support among his remaining loyalists",0
1,"Over in Israel,Netanyahu can appearto be making statesmanlike decisions ahead of a likely bruising election",0
1,it cannot be a coincidencethat he was in the USwhenthe bombing happened - a nod perhaps to a US green light and the durability of that continued relationship,0

1,"Breaching EU competition rules,the pipeline project could have gone through",0
1,it had allowed access to suppliers other than Gazprom,0

0,"As a result, Putin declaredthat resources will be directed towardsupgrading gas pipeline infrastructure linking Russia to Turkey - or even building an altogether new pipeline,in an attemptto save face and offset the losses incurred over South Stream",2
1,This decision underscores the pragmatism in the wayMoscow and Ankara deal with each other,0
1,"Meetings and official phone conversations between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, more than 35 over the past few years, usually follow a very similar script",0

1,"It is, furthermore, the second biggest market for Russian gas exports outside the former Soviet Union, with Germany again the frontrunner",0
1,Turkish construction firms have carved out a niche in the Russian market,0

1,the Turkish city of Antalya hosts the next G20 summit,0
1,there will be a renewed emphasis on Turkey's transformation into a global leader rather than a pliant western periphery,0

0,He would liketo see progress on Rosatom's $20bn projectto build Turkey's first nuclear power station at Akkuyu near Mersin,2
1,Construction work is expectedto start in May,0
1,reportedly Putin has insisted on a preferential treatment for the Russian state company by the Turkish tax authorities,0
1,that Erdogan has held his ground this time around,0
1,Rosatom has not obtainedwhatit wanted,0
1,Putin's visit will be remembered for the South Stream announcement,0
1,"whatis most remarkable about itis the continued development of Russian- Turkish relations, amid mounting tensions between Putin and the West",0
1,"The story of the Ezadeen, the ship set on autopilot and set towards Europe with 450fleeing Syrian refugees on board,could be a turning point in the European response to the crisis in Syria",0
1,"With a conflictthat has killed some 200,000 people burning brightly on its doorstepEurope's prime focus to date has been onensuringthat it stays away from the flames",0
1,"The emergence of ""ghost ships"", the latest gruesome tacticto come out of a conflictthat has also put the ""barrel bomb"" into the popular lexicon,may force a much needed revaluation on the strategy of Europe's response",0
1,The discovery of the Ezadeen is simply the latest in an increasing number of horror stories emerging from the Mediterranean Sea,0
0,"The boat, aptly a former livestock carrier, was found in rough seas some 40 nautical miles off the Italian coast - the second vessel in four daysto be found sailing abandoned by its crew",2
1,The ghost ships represent both a new tactic - using large cargo shipsto move people in winter across longer crossing- and a new trend - that of the refugees coming from Syria,0
4,"Last year some 230,000 people arrived illegally across the Mediterranean into the EU with Italy receiving the lion's share of 160,000 whilst 3,500 people diedtryingto make the crossing",2
5,"The UNHCR explainedthat in 2014 for the first time, people mainly from Syria ""have become a major component in this tragic flow, accounting for almost 50 per cent of the total""",2
1,"The policy of the EU has largely been one of ""Fortress Europe"" characterised by the reduction of humanitarian support to sea born refugees and tighter border fences to the east",0
0,"Whilst Syria's neighbours have accepted the lion's share of the over 3 million Syrian refugeesEurope's record remains dismal with a recent summit agreeing on only 33,000 more asylum cases",2
1,EU policy is as adrift as many of the refugeeswho struggle to survive in the Med,0
1,The sudden up tick in refugees attemptingto travel from Syria and the high risk ghost shipsthat are usedshould prompt a review of both the national polices of EU member states and the supra-national EU policy at large,0
4,"The conflict in Syria is getting worse with 5,000 Syriansfleeing every day (over three a minute)",2
1,2015 could seethe number of refugees top 4 million,0
1,Europe needsto adopt a more strategic and moral policy towards the Syrian refugee crisis rather than the current positionwhose failureis measured in the increasing numbers of lives lost to the Mediterranean,0
1,It is far easierto attract the attention of policy makers with a counter- terrorism argument than a humanitarian one,0
1,"The fact isthat the smugglerswho are purchasing ships for between $100,000 - $150,000 and then filling them up with hundreds of desperate refugeespaying $6,000 per person for passageare making serious illicit money",0
1,"Criminal gangs in North Africa and the Middle Eastthat experts warnare ""making millions""should be a red flag considering the current conflict with trans-national criminals such as ISIL",0
1,Resources should be put intoa joined up policing effortthat addresses the spacethat these increasingly wealthy smugglers are ableto operate in,0
5,"The Syrians taking this journey are risking itall on whatthe UNHCR are calling the ""most lethal route in the world""",2
5,"One refugee on board the Ezadeen putit succinctlywhenhe told Italian Coast Guardsthat ""we are aloneandwe have no oneto help us""",2
1,"We must better understandthat a conflictthat has seen over 12,000 children killed -3,500 last year alone-is goingto force people to desperate endsto find hope of a better tomorrow",0
1,Europe must look seriously intoaccepting larger asylum quotasand focus ongiving the most vulnerable a legitimate means ofgetting to their shores,0
1,Meanwhile ifthe conditions for the vast majority of those refugees in the neighbouring countries deteriorate then againit shouldn't be a surpriseto seerefugees risk their livesto travel elsewhere,0
1,The factthat the World Food Programme hadto briefly cut food rations to Syrian refugees due to lack offunding in Decemberis a scandalthat shouldn't be allowedto happen again,0
1,Finally of course we should never lose sight of the bigger picture,0
1,"The refugees,whethersheltering from winter in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon or enduring the waves of the Mediterranean,are all symptoms of a conflictwhose end appears nowhere in sight",0
1,A new year gives Europe a chanceto involveitself a new onaddressing that most difficult of challenges,0
1,Politicians have gonemad,0
4,"The NHS isto be rescued with?2bn from the banks (Tories), with ?2.5bn from cigarettes (Labour), with ?1.5bn from London mansions (Labour), with the same ?1.5bn for Scottish nurses (Scottish Labour) or with ?8bn ""from the proceeds of growth"" (the Lib Dems)",2
1,"Or it can always be rescued with ""efficiency savings"" (everyone, for the past decade)",0
0,"Meanwhile six hospitals have declared ""major incidents""",2
1,(which admittedly have a broad definition under NHS guidance),0
1,Accident and emergency delivery is at its worst for a decade,0
1,There is a chronic shortage of A&E; doctors and beds,0
1,"The NHS boss, Simon Stevens, lets not a month pass withoutdemanding money with menaces from ministers, and usually getting it",0
1,"His doctors, long adept at financial terrorism, have the politicians by the short hairs",0
1,The result is political panic,0
1,any service is free,0
1,demand is unlimited,0
1,Aneurin Bevan fearedthe NHS would put doctors out of work,0
1,people got richer and less ill,0
1,He was wrong,0
1,Asthey got richthey lived longer and demanded more care,0
1,"Even wherecare costs money,as in America, demand soars",0
4,"The NHS needs 5% more cash a year in real termsto meet rising demand,without improvement",2
1,There is no waythis can continue indefinitely,0
1,"So whatdemand is unlimited,supply must be rationed somehow",0
1,"economists know,ifit is not rationed by payment - as in most insurance-based health services - it is rationed ""by congestion"", byqueueing",0
1,That isprecisely whatis now happening in the NHS,0
1,"The service worsens, the rich move to private insurance while the poor queue, for hours, days, months",0
1,Britain's cancer performance shows the result,0
4,More Britons die of cancer delays than in insurance-based health services,2
1,"The NHS frontline - surgeries and A&E; departments - are crippled by the strain of trivial visits for minor injuries, repeat prescriptions or just lonely people and confused immigrants",0
1,There is no waythis can be sustained sufficiently or efficiently,0
1,Desperate attempts at internal pricing have led hospital trust A&E; departmentsto close,0
1,becausethey lose money,0
1,They cannot charge or turn away even drunks and nuisance patients,0
1,"More and more doctors are now pleading for payment for frontline treatments, recoverable in certain cases",0
1,"There is no other wayany government can restore 24-hour care and a ""personal"" GP service",0
1,Rationing by paymentmay offend tradition,0
1,rationing by chaosis cruel,0
1,Britain is just one step away from a network of private A&E; centres,0
1,That would be a catastrophe for NHS staffing,0
1,Yet no politician has the courageto proposewhatis neededto stop it,0
1,"Whenthe people of Greece go to the polls on 25 January,they will face some fairly fundamental choices",0
1,"Contrary towhatmany politicians and commentators would haveyou believe,this election is not aboutwhetherGreeks wantto stay in the euro",0
1,a majority clearly wants to,0
1,The real question iswhetherthis latest turn in the drama will finally force Greek politiciansto act in their country's long-term interest,0
1,"Opinion polls suggest that Greek voters oscillate between anger and fear: anger about the enormous coststhey have hadto bear in the course of the adjustment programme;and fear ofwhatwould happenifAlexis Tsipras, head of the hard-left Syriza movementthat still leads in the polls,triesto force through another cut in Greece's international debt",0
0,"In the last debt restructuring in 2012, the creditors already promisedto helpGreece reduce its debt to more sustainable levelsby 2020 - providedAthens continuesto improve its budget",2
2,The Greeks have a democratic rightto elect a leaderwho wantsto tear up this agreement,2
2,"just as Germans,Dutch, Finns and others have a rightto elect governmentsthat insist on such deals being adheredto",2
5,AlthoughTsipras sayshe does not wantto leave the euro,2
1,the resulting showdown could force Greece out of the single currency,0
1,"Today, the spectre of ""Grexit"" is more threatening to the Greeks than to the rest of Europe",0
1,"Reforms in Spain, Portugal and Ireland have madethese countries more resilient",0
1,International rescue funds and the European Central Bank stand readyto helpincase panic should nevertheless spread,0
5,Five out of Germany's eight leading economic research institutes thinkthe eurozone could now cope with a Greek exit,2
1,"This does not mean, however,that Germany or the other eurozone countries wantGreece to leave",0
1,"Even ifcontagion was limited,another worsening of the eurozone crisis would undermine confidence, stunt the region's fragile recovery and makeEurope's leaders -many of whom have declared the crisis over- look inept",0
1,The political and economic consequences for other European countries would be severe,0
1,the rest of Europe does not wantto be blackmailed,0
1,it will likely be readyto talk,0
1,"The new Greek government,whetherit is led by the incumbent premier Antonis Samaras, Tsipras, or a new coalition,could reasonably demand a new grand bargain",0
1,under which the ECB-IMF-EC troika of lenders agreesto revisit the debt issuewhilethe Greek government promisesto make the economy fit for the future,0
1,"Economic reform, however, is hardlywhatGreek politicians are talking about in this election campaign",0
1,"Greek voters face the unenviable choice between re-electing the mainstream politicianswho landed Greece in its current mess in the first place,or voting for Tsipras or other populistswho make unrealistic promises of higher wages and more security",0
1,The trouble is notthat Tsipras is radical,0
1,it isthat he is not radical enough,0
1,"Bypromising state handouts to voters and protection for vested interests,he is perpetuating the dysfunctional systemthat plunged Greece into crisis",0
1,"Over the past few years, the ruling coalition between the two established parties has tried a tricky balancing act ofpreserving the system of bureaucratic cronyismthat since the 1970s they have helpedto build,and modernising Greece's state and economy",0
1,aspromised to international lenders,0
1,"The result was an often agonisingly slow process of to and fro, with troika officials regularly departing in frustration about Greek foot-dragging",0
1,It is not only the troika's emphasis on austeritythat has caused the Greek people so much pain,0
1,As important wasthat huge adjustments were foisted upon an extraordinarily rigid economy,0
1,"Despite much effortto open up mollycoddled sectors since 2010,Greece is still one of Europe's most overregulated economies",0
1,"Sluggish bureaucracies and exaggerated form-filling are the main reasonGreece's exports have not rebounded like those of Spain, Portugal and Ireland",0
1,The absence of a reliable land registry is holding back investment,0
1,An unreformed social security system still benefits better-off households more than the destitute,0
1,the tax burden on ordinary people has risen,0
1,wealthy individuals and companies can still often evade their dues,0
1,"And wages in the public sector have fallen - but nowhere near as fast as those in the private sector, despite starting from a much higher level",0
1,Greek politicians must get serious aboutremoving the shackles from the economy,0
5,"Economists thinkthe benefits of structural reforms could materialise quickly in Greece's inefficient economy, and would be substantial",2
5,The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimatesthat Greek businesses could save hundreds of millions of euros a yearifthe government scrapped burdensome regulations,2
4,The Greek thinktank IOBE calculatesthat improvements to the business and investment environment could lift GDP by more than 2% in just two years,2
5,stepsto increase competition in industries and serviceswould have an even bigger impact,2
1,Greece has startedbuilding a sounder economy on the wreckage of a public sector bubble and a strangulated private sector,0
1,The costs have been exorbitant,0
1,It would be a real Greek tragedyifthe country's next government squandered the potential gains and reversed the process,0
1,"Asinternational leaders gathered in London this weekto discuss Afghanistan,we once again heard familiar proclamations of support for Afghanistan and renewed commitments towards its people, particularly women and girls",0
1,"International partners promisedto continueto assist Afghanistan through its ""transformation decade"",but also underlinedthat asNATO completes it military mission,they also expectthe country to stand on its own feet",0
1,This message has its merits,0
1,International donors have been generous ingiving billions in foreign aidto Afghanistan,0
2,Countless lives - foreigners and Afghans - have been lost in the violence,2
0,"Asthe military transition completes,Afghanistan is also ushering in a new government, headed by President Ashraf Ghani",2

1,"As a regular visitor to the war-torn country, I, too, believethat Afghans possess the ingenuity, resilience and desireto transform from poverty to prosperity",0
1,"There have been remarkable, often unacknowledged, gains in Afghanistan",0
1,"For years,asthe Taliban ruled,Afghanistan was the world's forgotten country",0
1,Human rights abuses were endemic,0
1,the population shrank,0
0,millions poured over the borders to Iran and Pakistan as refugees,2
1,Women were kept from schools and employment and forced into early marriages,0
1,"Today, many of those refugees have returned home",0

1," they are growing, with women almost always suffering the most",0

0,Many shared with me the worriesthey have aboutbeing ableto put food on the table for their families,2
4,a concern all the more alarminggiventhat 1.2 million of the country's children presently suffer from malnutrition,2
2,"Women without the support of male family members; those widowed, abandoned,who have escaped abuse or care for a disabled husband,are particularly vulnerable",2
2,there can be no quick fix for war,2
2,there is no easy solution for decades of women's rights abuses,2
1,Women are much more likelyto be more disadvantaged than their husband or brother,0
1,"many face extreme poverty, physical and psychological violence, illiteracy and discrimination in all facets of life",0
1,There are still deeply entrenched social stigmas towards women working or pursuing education,0
1,Many Afghan women are not aware of their rights,0
1,their voices are too rarely heard,0
0,"I am proudthat the Norwegian Refugee Council works directly with thousands of women at a community levelto educate them about their legal rights, and helpthem navigate systems and processesthat still too often discriminate against them",2
1," despite these needs, despite the tenuous gains in women's rights, international humanitarian supportto help Afghanistanis actually declining",0
0,"In 2014, the UN lowered its humanitarian appeal by 14 percent, in recognitionthat donors would not provide adequate funding for a larger appeal",2
0,The US - by far the largest donor - halved its development aid in 2014,2
0,"In August, the World Food Programme announcedthat a $40m funding shortfall meantthat they were forcedto cut food rations",2
1,meaning food shortagesare likelyto grow,0
1,We hear all too oftenthat girls' schools are facing closure because of lack of future funding,0
1,"In many respects, the realities in Afghanistan today have been an uneasy backdrop to the London Conference",0
1,international partners have again committedto support Afghanistan,0
1,"this must be matched with donors making real, long-term contributions",0
1,"ForAfghanistan to be the country of prosperity, freedom and safetywe wantit to be,andwith full support for women's rights, international governments must produce a set of genuine commitments and pledges, includingaddressing the most pressing humanitarian needs",0
1,"Ordinary Afghans, women in particular, must be reassuredthat ""transformation"" doesn't equate to a reduction in the world's interest or concern for their lives",0
1,We have no excuses,0
1,We knowwhatneedsto be done,0
1,New Jersey governor Chris Christie's weight - and whetherit will impact any run for higher office- is once again the subject of discussion,0
1,"(Itcomes up every year or so,andthis year it's boundto come up every month or so.)",0
0,"On Sunday, Christie drew some people's ire bysitting with (ok, and hugging) the owner of the Dallas Cowboys",2
0,the team of which he is a fan,2
1,"It doesn't actually seemto matterwhatChristie does, though",0
1,"the kneejerk reaction to a hefty politician is always, inevitably,to insult his body",0
1,now Christie's brother is even reacting to that reaction on Facebook,0
1,Fat people are describedas gross and disgustingoften enoughthat some of us loathe our own bodies to the point of self-injury,0
1,"People thinkwe're stupid and weak(or we'd just lose weight, right?)before they even talk to us",0
2,Fatness is classified as a disease in the United States,2
0,"For his part, Christie, with his long history ofbeing fat in the public eye,turned to a weight-loss surgery called lap band in his effortsto lose weight",2
1,"In that last linked article, those close to him claimedit would humanize him in the eyes of the public - withoutrecognizingthat he is, in fact and in fat, already human",0
1,Our humanity hardly seemsto matter to people going for the easy fat jokes,0
1,The truth isthat fat people often have a more difficult time finding a good job,0
1,"(Even,maybe especially, THE job",0
1,You're less likelyto get a promotionwhenyour body doesn't match the image of a desirable employee,0
1,This bias - this discrimination - on the part of employerscosts them top talent and actually winds upadding to stereotypes about us,0
1,It's hard for fat peopleto be perceived as hard workerswhenno one believes in our work ethic in the first place,0
0,"that's hardly the worst of the stereotypes: a couple of years ago, during a televised ""debate"" about fatness and fat acceptance with anti-obesity spokesperson MeMe Roth and model Crystal Renn,Roth finally gave in and calledme stupid",2
5,using a single studythat proclaimthat fat people just have smaller brains and are therefore less intelligent,2
0,I laughed,2
1,it was a desperate attempt at an insult morethanit was scientific discussion,0
1,it was also honest,0
0,becauseit's definitely not the first timeI've run across that conviction,2
1,"Chris Christie, for all of his accomplishments, faces the same sort of discrimination as the fat person passed over for a job because of a hiring manager's bias",0
1,he's just facing it on a very intense and public level,0
1,People look at him and judge his body,0
1,They don't evaluate his intelligence based on his decisions,0
1,they just assumehe's stupidbecausehe's fat,0
1,They ignorethat it does actually take quite a lot of workto get elected as governor,0
2,"politics is many things,butit's never a cake walk",2
0,he's been involved since 1977,2
0,"And America has had fat presidents before - not many of them, but some rather notable ones, including Teddy Roosevelt",2
1,Chris Christie is- andthis is another uncomfortable thing for someone with my own fairly radical political viewsto say- a complicated and intelligent politician,0
1,His actions are often well-considered,0
1,"(even whenI screamingly disagree with them,which happens a lot)and even sometimes moderate, at least in the sensethat he occasionally works across party lines ... and certainly across state lineswhenit comes to the NFL",0
1,But the fat jokes keep on coming,0
0,How bouthittin the gym??,2
1,Christie won't back down,0
5,"US News & World Report's David Catanese even saidthat his brother's defense makesChristie looks bad because...he countered ""'crazy, pathetic posts' with one of his own""",2
1,Apparently it's more presidentialwhenyou take the abuse about your body without anyone saying anything,0
1,And the fat jokes keepobscuring the actual conversationthat needsto happen about Christie's political views,0
1,he remains cagey aboutrunning for the Republican nomination in 2016,0
1,you're one of the people,0
1,who'd rather insult his weight than talk about his politics,0
1,"I haveto ask:who is the less intelligent person, really?",0
1,I don't thinkit's the fat guy,0
1,The last thinga beleaguered Vladimir Putin will wantto hearisthat Russia has now reached the stagewhereit desperately needs an IMF-supported economic adjustment program,0
1,"Without such a program, it is difficultto seehowRussia can regain domestic and international confidence in the management of its economy",0
1,"Absent the IMF,it is also difficultto seehowRussia will be ableto avoid the imposition of damaging capital controls on its economy",0
1,There can be no denyingthat Russian policymakers were totally blindsided by the collapse in international oil prices from around $110 a barrel in midsummerto $50 a barrel at present,0
1,"All too likely this will proveto have been a very costly lapse in economic policy judgment, particularly considering that energy accounts for around two-thirds of Russian exports and around half of its tax revenues",0
1,A dramatic drop in international oil prices would have been difficult for Russia in normal times,0
1,these are hardly normal times for Russia,0
0,effective financial sanctions are being imposed on it in the context of the ongoing Ukrainian crisis,2
4,Those sanctions have precipitated more than $100 billion in capital flight from Russia since the start of this year,2
1,They are also seriously restricting the ability of Russian corporationsto refinance their large U.S  dollar debtscoming due,0
1,"Inresponding to a burgeoning balance of payments crisis,Russian policymakers appearto have made every mistake in the book",0
1,The central bank was painfully slowto use its large international reserves or interest rate policyto calm market fears about the currency's stability,0
1,"Compounding matters,the central bank has managedto convey the impressionthat the Russian government stands fully behind the Russian corporate sector's more than $600 billion in foreign currency debt",0
4,"Worse yet, the central bank's actions have not been backed up by any serious adjustment to the government's spending plans, despite the factthat the oil price now is around 50 percent below the level assumed in the government's budget",2
1, there have been no proposalsto reform the insidious interconnection between the government and the corporate sectors,0
1,which has seriously undermined confidence in the management of the economy,0
4,"With the governmentseemingly at sea, the Russian ruble,has lost almost half of its value since the start of the year",2
1,This is somethingthat Russia can ill-afford,0
4,consideringthat inflation is already over 9 percent,2
1,that the Russian people are all too familiar with the pain associated with very high inflation rates,0
1,The public is already starting to hoard groceries,0
1,beforethey get more expensive,0
1,people are rushing to their ATMs,0
1,the going is still good,0
1,It would seemto be only a matter of timebeforethey startrunning on their banks,0
1,Experience amply suggeststhat it is very hardto regain economic confidenceonceit has been lost,0
1,The countries in Russia's dire economic circumstancesthat have succeededhave done so in the context of a carefully coordinated economic adjustment programthat had the imprimatur of an outside independent agency like the IMF,0
1,"For Vladimir Putinto successfully approach the IMF,he would haveto back down on his Ukrainian adventureto win Western support",0
1,Consideringthat to be highly unlikelyRussians should brace themselves for a rough economic ride next year,0
1,For not only isit all too likelythat Russia will experiencea deep economic recession and double-digit inflation,0
1,It will also be subjected to capital controlsthat will further distort Russia's already highly distorted economy,0
1,Defaulting on sovereign debtis never a good strategy,0
1,Just ask Argentina,0
0,The South American nation has defaulted 10 times- -most recently this summer--on its international obligations and has experienced sharp economic decline as a result,2
4,"In the early 1900s, Argentina ranked among the world's top 10 in per capita income",2
4,"By 2012, it had fallen to 55th",2
1," Argentina is opting for stubbornness, bullying and intimidation of its debt-holders, all with a helping hand from the United Nations",0
1,it refusesto pay back bondholders for billions of dollars,0
1,"WhatArgentina wantsisto establish ""a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.""",0
1,"Such a multilateral endeavor -- established, run, and funded by governments -- will no doubt be more sympathetic to financial deadbeats like Argentina than a U.S  courtthat hasto give equal standing to the private sector",0
1,"It's also the kind of thingthat the United Nations lovesto endorse:high- minded and technical sounding, larded with ostensible respect for international legal processes, and standing above any single national interest--with absolutely no chance whatsoeverthat it will be any of these things",0
1,"Sure enough, Argentina has successfully rallied a majority of U.N  member nationsto join indenouncing Argentina's debt holders and endorsing its multilateral debt restructuring framework",0
0,"This September the U.N  General Assembly voted 124-11, with 41 abstentions,to support Argentina's position",2
0,"The U.N  Human Rights Council soon followed suit,adopting a similar resolution 33-5,with 9 abstentions",2
5,"The notorious Council,which includessome of the world's worst human rights violators in its membership,got involvedbecauseit saysexcessive debt is an impediment to full realization of ""social, economic and cultural"" rights",2
1,It is certainly truethat debt defaults take a huge toll,0
1,"the defaulting country loses access to international financial markets and foreign exchange,limiting its abilityto finance expenditures and obligations and pay for imported goods",0
1,The end result is typically sharp recession and rising unemployment,0
1,But Argentina's latest default is is different from earlier defaults,0
1,which were driven by economic crises,0
1,"The 2014 crisis, though rooted in a previous $100 billion defaultthat occurred 13 years ago,is a deliberate--and unnecessary--choice of the Argentine government",0
0,"In 2005 and 2010, Argentina offered to exchange bondsthat it had defaulted on at about 35 cents on the dollar",2
0, about 93 percent of debt holders agreed to the swap,2
0,"Some debt holders, however, held out and went to U.S  courtarguingthat Argentina hadto pay them the full value of their bonds",2
0,"In 2012, a U.S  judge ruled in their favor and further ruledthat any financial institutionthat assisted in partial paymentwould be in contempt",2
1,"Following the court's ruling, Argentina could have complied or at least paid interest on the bondswhiletryingto renegotiate a more favorable debt arrangement",0
1,"Instead, this summer it decidedto pay nothing, abandon negotiations, and rely on demagogueryto press its case in the court of public opinion",0
1,"Argentina has denounced its debt holders--shrilly and often--as ""vulture"" funds",0
1,"Of course, it never mentionsthat it was Argentinathat voluntarily issued the debt in the first place, presumably in good faith",0
1,Nor does it acknowledgethat the government's own reckless economic policies precipitated the debt crisis in the first place,0
1,"Ifyou thinkthat sort of dishonest name-calling would fall on deaf ears,you don't know the United Nations",0
1,Argentina's success inrallying a majority of U.N  member nationsto join indenouncing the debt holdersresults from an underlying fact,0
1,"At the U.N  the agenda of many developing nations consists ofblaming others for the consequences their poor economic choices and demandingthat the developed nations provide more aid, less accountability for money already given, and no rightto objectwhenfeckless countries misbehave",0
2,The U.N  resolutions in support of Argentina do not have the force of law,2
1,"But the intended goal is clearlyto establish a ""a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes"" via a treaty or international convention",0
1,"Historically, U.N  resolutions are the first step in this process",0
1,"That is clearly the hope of Hector Timerman, Argentina's Minister for Foreign Affairs",0
1,who made clearwhyhis country had pressed so hardto get the resolutions,0
5,"""Vulturefunds will not stopuntilwe put the brake on...,""he declared",2
5,"""The resolution not only condemns vulture's activities, but also urgesthe UN to investigate their behavior and analyze their effect over sovereign economies.""",2
1,"In other words, he is arguing:Let's point the finger at someone elseto avoid responsibility for our own economic failings",0
1,"Asthe U.S  made clear in its statement opposing the effort,the terms of debt obligations are subject to review, renegotiation, or negation by a governmentasit feels like it",0
5,the cost of lending to everyone will riseto meet the perceived risk,2
1,Indeed many countries may findit impossibleto access international capital markets at all,0
1,"And many of the countries hardest hit will be a lot poorer than Argentina, a middle income countrythat has never learnedto live within its means",0
1,U.N.-endorsed demagoguery is no wayto resolve a problem of habitual economic and fiscal incompetence,0
1,"Unfortunately, however, it may be an effective means forseducing other countriesto join Argentina in the misery ofbeing a financial pariah",0
1,Establishing ties with Cubahas been on President Obama's bucket list for some time,0
1,This last one also has the added bonus pointthat it putshim right with the international left,0
1,which lionizes Castro,0
1,And the president will go onpicking off the next items on the bucket list for the next two years of his termunlessCongress decidesto stop him,0
1,Should they work up the gumption,0
1,lawmakers will findthey can do many thingsto stand up for the prerogatives of the legislative branch,0
1,"Obviously, the release of the 65-year-old American hostage Alan Gross should be welcome",0
0,"His ""crime"" wasto bring computers to Jews on the island",2
1,"For the last five years, he has been a victim of Cuba's state terrorism",0
1,just as11 million Cubans have been held hostage by their government for the past five decades,0
1,"Exchanging three hardened Cuban spies for Gross, establishes an insulting moral and legal equivalency",0
0,The spies actions led to the death of an American in the 1990s,2
1,they were duly convicted,0
1,Their release in exchange for Gross createsan incentive for rogue regimes and individual actors to kidnap Americans all over the world,0
1,Notonly doesPresident Obama's action failto advance freedom in Cuba,0
1,it throws a lifeline to Cuba's dictators,0
1,"whose current supplier of funds, Venezuela,is on the ropes because ofplunging oil prices",0
1,It surrenders to the demands for normalizationthat the Castros have been making for decades,0
1,So whatcan Congress do?,0
1,"Right off the bat, Congress must makeit crystal clear to President Obamathat he lacks the authorityto lift the embargo on Cuba, allow tradeto take place between the two nations,lettourists to go to Cubato bail out the regimeor giveCuba have access to capital markets",0
1,U.S  law--the Helms-Burton Act of 1996--givesthe Congress power to override any action taken by the executiveto lift the embargo,0
1,"In orderto lift the embargo,the Cuban government would haveto give the Cuban people a number of rights--of association, speech, political activity, etc ",0
1,that President Obama obviously failedto secure in his 45-minute conversation with Cuban dictator Raul Castro Tuesday,0
1,Congress can also make clear to the presidentthat there are statutory criteriathat must be met,0
1,beforehis administration can take Cuba off the State Department list of terrorism sponsors,0
1,The president must inform Congressthat there has been a change of leadership and policies of the Cuban governmentandthat Castro has given assurancesthat it will no longer support terrorist acts,0
1,Can President Obama do any of that?,0
1,Senators should also make clearthat they will put a hold on any ambassadorthat Mr  Obama nominatesto serve in Cuba,0
1,he can guaranteethat the Cuban government is no longer a threat to the United Statesand has decidedto grant freedom to people in Cuba,0
5,"Sen  Marco Rubio, R-Fla , has already saidhe plansto do that",2
1, Congress can look into the possibility ofusing policy riders in the upcoming DHS appropriations debate in February and the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations processto deny the president funds forsetting up relations,0
1,Congress must act,0
1,becausePresident Obama has been completely feckless in his entire approach to Cuba,0
1,He received nothing in exchange for many substantial concessions made to the Communist regime,0
1,"After five years of ""negotiations"" President Obama endedexactly whereRaul Castro's demands began five years ago",0
5,"As Senator Marco Rubio said, President ""Obama is the worst negotiator since Carter.""",2
1,"Mr  Obama's statement was filled with Havana's communist talking points, such asaffirmingthat Cubans are poor and unfree because of the embargo,orthat Cuba was a U.S  colony",0
1,None of that is true,0
1,yet Mr  Obama said it,0
1,Congress must actto limitthe damage inherent in this Havana Giveaway,0
1,Obama will simply move on to the next misguided item on his bucket list,0
1,"Recent reports of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reopening its embassies in Baghdad and in the capital of the Kurdish Regional Government, Erbil, may appearto be an overdue, yet mundane diplomatic affair",0
1,this news signifies a development in Saudi foreign policy to Iraq,0
0,diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Baghdad were severed after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990,2
0,Saudi Arabia failedto reopen diplomatic facilities in Iraqastensions ensued with the post-Baathist government,2
1,"The recent news serves as an indicationthat Riyadh has finally come to terms with a Shia-led government in Baghdad, and is now seeking a presence in Iraqto influence developments there on an official, bilateral level",0
1,"In terms of regional power dynamics, the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in 2003 affected all of Iraq's neighbours",0
0,Jordan and Syria hadto deal with an influx of Iraqi refugees,2
1,Both Syria and Iran fearedthe Bush administration would use Iraq as a baseto destabilise their regimes,0
1,Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia fearedthat the empowered Kurds and Shia in Iraq after 2003 would foment similar aspirations among their respective Kurdish and Shia populations,0
1,The reopening of embassies in Baghdad after the US-led occupation had been a contentious issue for regional actors in the Middle East,0
0,The new politicians in Iraq hadto urge various Arab states and organisationsto reopen their embassies in Baghdadin orderto bestow some regional legitimacy upon a nascent Iraqi government,2
1,The Arab League hesitatedreopening its diplomatic facilities in Baghdad as an indirect way ofprotesting the factthat an Arab capital was under foreign control,0
0,Baghdad repeatedly askedSyria to open up its embassy in Baghdad,2
1,hopingthat diplomatic relations would end Syria's policy ofgranting refuge to former Baathistsand supporting the Iraqi insurgency immediately following the 2003 invasion,0
1,"For Saudi Arabia, the failureto open an embassy in Baghdadhad lessto do withthe presence of US forces occupying an Arab capital,but rather as a means ofprotesting the rise of a new Shia-led government in Iraq",0
0,"After the Iranian Revolution of 1979,Saudi Arabia's Shia beganto protest,demanding more rights from the Saudi government",2
1,the fear in Riyadh wasthat the ascent of a Shia-led government in Iraq could ignite similar protests in 2003,0
1,Saudi Arabia's fears of renewed unrest among its Shia population in its oil-rich Eastern province is an internal domestic issue,0
1, the Iraq War of 2003 also represented a foreign policy setback on the regional level,0
1,"Iraq under Saddam Hussein, even a weak Iraq after 1991, still served as a buffer against Iran",0
0,which had rivalled Riyadh for regional hegemony in the Middle East and the greater Islamic world since 1979,2
1,fighting proxy wars from Lebanon to Pakistan,0
1,"After 2003, Saudi Arabia watchedasIran's influence grew in Iraq",0
1,"which was backing Baghdad's first Shia-led government,in addition to Tehran influencing events in the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, another stateSaudi Arabia considers as its backyard",0
1,"Not onlyhad Iranian influence outflanked Saudi Arabia on both sides of its borders,butfrom the perspective of Riyadh, the Arab Spring protests of Bahrain were deemed as an Iranian-backed project",0
1," Iran seemed on the verge ofnot only acquiring a nuclear programme, but also reaching at least a de facto working relationship with the US in the region",0
1,Saudi Arabia was initially reluctantto challenge the status quo bysupporting the protests and rebellion against Syria's Bashar al-Assad,0
0,it weighed in on the side of the rebels,2
1,"in this proxy war, Iran also defeated Saudi aspirations bykeepingthe incumbent government in Damascus alive",0
5,"The regional situation in the Middle East has been described by Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, as the Middle Eastern Thirty Years War,oras a new sectarian Cold War waged by Iran and Saudi Arabia",2
1,one wereto use either analogy,0
1,then Iran is definitely winning this conflict,0
1,"From this perspective, the news ofreopeningthe Saudi embassies emerges in the context of a reassessment of Riyadh's foreign policy, released at a fortuitous time",0
1,King Abdullah is hospitalisedand worriesemergeof whatthis means for the future leadership of the Kingdom,0
1, the decisionto reopen the embassiesreflect a sustained period of quiet diplomacythat preceded the king's health condition,0
1,The first indicationthat Iran and Saudi Arabia were beginningto cooperate over Iraq's futureoccurred after the ISIL offensive into Mosul in the summer of 2014,0
0,"Both Tehran and Riyadh agreed on Haider al-Abbadi as a replacement to Iraq's incumbent Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki",2
1,This agreement represents an evolution from the Saudi side,0
1,as evident from a Wikileaks cablewhereKing Abdullah expressed his personal dislike of Maliki in a meeting with US officials,0
1,a thaw in relations occurredafterIraq's president visited Riyadh and met with the king in November 2014,0
0,a Saudi-Iraqi agreement was reachedto combat ISIL,2
1,This agreement is significant given the number of Iraqis in both the state and societywho blame the rise of ISIL on Saudi Arabia in the first place as the financial and ideological incubator of this group,0
0," Iraqi public service announcements encouragedIraqisto inform on ""foreign"" terrorists",2
1,"invoking an image of a bearded man with a short thobe, handing out funds to local Iraqis,to stir up problems in Iraq",0
1,"It appearsthat Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia have come to the conclusionthat whenit comesto combatting ISIL,all three parties needto reach a modus vivendi",0
1,"one choosesto employ short hand monikersto describe the state of affairs in the region, rather than a ""Thirty Years War"" or a ""Cold War""",0
1,"regional actors in the Middle East have finally come to an agreementthat they are waging their own ""War on Terror"" against ISIL",0
1,We have now embarked on the longest general election campaign in the history of Britain,0
1,Even political obsessives quail at the thought,0
1,So I plead guilty tobringing a little genuine political debate into the process so early on in the process,0
1,"The issue is the new Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, and his vainglorious boastthat he is goingto use mansion tax money from London and the south-eastto pay for 1,000 new nurses in Scotland",0
1,Letme stressthat I support the mansion tax in principle,0
1,It is a redistributive tax,0
1,which is important,0
1,taxes on assets are always worthconsidering,0
1,"The complication isthat it is, in effect, a tax on London, 80% ofwhich will be paid by people in London and the south -east",0
1,And the distorted nature of London's housing market could mean a tax with wildly distorted effects,0
1,No one really knowshow muchit will raise,0
1,It seems likelythat the people everyone agreesshould pay it-the international super-wealthy - will use their expensive lawyers and accountantsto evade it,0
1,"But it will hit older Londoners, often public sector workerswho bought houses inwhatwere then unfashionable parts of London",0
0,"as in my constituency, Hackney North and Stoke Newington",2
1,Now they are living in houses worth ?1m and rising,0
1,They are often asset rich but cash poor,0
1,Having seenLondon house prices spiral in value,0
1,they are not reassured by the ideathat the mansion tax kicks in only at?2m,0
1,"At the very least, a lot of work needsto be put into reassure those voters, and to fashion a taxthat will not hit those people unfairly",0
1,"Fortunately the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has an open mind on the subject",0
1,"That iswhyit is surprisingthat Murphy has jumped in feet first,boasting abouthowhe will spend money from a tax",0
1,there is no agreement onexactly howit will be levied,0
1,I am a unionist,0
1,I understandthat the Labour party has a big electoral challenge in Scotland,0
1,But I cannot believethat Scottish voters will be taken in by a crude attemptto buy their votes with money expropriated from London,0
1,Murphy is really interested inredistributing wealth,0
1,whyisn't he talking about council tax revaluation or levels of income tax in Scotland?,0
1,Instead he seeks cheap applause bytelling the Scotshowhe will extract money from England,0
0,"Recently there has been a series ofreports, including from the London Finance Commission and the Royal Society of Arts City Growth Commission, calling for the devolution of powers to our great cities",2
5, experts are sayingthat big cities should be allowedto keep their property taxes,2
1,I believethat this process should start with the mansion tax,0
1,Devolution cannot be for Scotland alone,0
1,there should also be devolution of powers to the cities and regions,0
1,Murphy cannot bully the rest of the UK about a considered devolution of fiscal powers to all our cities with a pre-emptive strike on the mansion tax,0
1,It is too easyto conflate London with bankers and the international glitterati,0
1,But London is more unequal than any other part of Britain,0
4,Child poverty is a third higher in London than the rest of England as a whole,2
1,"So, general election campaign or not,we need a proper debate on devolution of powers to our great cities",0
1,It is part of the battle against the povertythat still exists in the shadow of the glittering towers of the City of London,0
1,And some people needto be preparedto stand up for London in this important debate,0
1,The coincidence couldn't be more striking,0
0,"AsTunisians prepare for a run-off in their first full presidential elections,an Egyptian court has declaredinvalid all remaining murder and corruption charges against former President Hosni Mubarak",2
1,which stemmed from his three decades of misrule and the hundreds killed in the brutal crackdownhe launchedto preserve it,0
1,denizens of Tunis debatewhetherinterim President Moncef Marzouki or Ben Ali era veteran Beji Caid Essebsi can best move the country forward,0
0,"security forces in Cairo fired on crowdswho attemptedto enterTahrir Square, the erstwhile centre of the revolution, to protest the Mubarak decision,killing at least one person while arresting dozens",2
1,The untold thousands of peaceful protesters and activists rotting in Egypt's jails and the cult of personality todaysurrounding President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi tell the story ofhowthe reluctant decision by Tahrir's revolutionariesto agree to a military-led transitionturned out,0
1,"In Tunisia, the elements of the state, such as the interior ministry, remain bastions of the ancien regime",0
1,But the country has undeniably moved further than any Arab country towards a real and sustainable democracy,0
1,This should not surprise anyone familiar with Tunisia's history,0
0,"asthe country boasts the Arab - indeed, Muslim -world's first modern constitution, from 1861, and has long been among the most cosmopolitan and open in the region",2
1,But the central issue today isprecisely howthe country built its post-Ben Ali leadership,0
0,"Whateverone wantsto say about the Islamist Nahda Party,its spiritual and political leader Rachid Ghannoushi re-entered Tunisian politics with a long history of supporting pluralism and democracy",2
0,"whenit was clearthat the party could not govern effectively,it ceded power and agreed to new elections",2
1,members have engaged in public self-criticism about its failings,0
0,"Equallyifnot more important,Marzouki is one of the Arab world'smost respected human rights figures",2
0,whose Congress for the Republic Party has brought together various opposition tendencies since its creation in 2001,2
1,His term in office has been far from a sterling success,0
1,"it could not have been otherwise,given the Herculean task ofbuilding a new governing system on the still functioning body of Ben Ali's mafia state",0
1,"But despite political assassinations, flaringreligious extremism, and deep- seated economic problems,the country has movedto solidify a new civil and democratic political system",0
1,The contrast with the Egyptian post-revolutionary leadership couldn't be clearer,0
1,There are many structural reasonswhyTunisia has progressed politicallywhileEgypt has seemingly returned to its pharaonic roots(asmany commentators liketo describe its penchant for authoritarian leaders),0
1,"The most prominent are the exponentially greater power of the Egyptian military vis-a-vis its North African counterpart and its far larger, and poorer, population",0
1,"But I would arguethat the centrality, at least politically, of human rights to the national discourse has been one of the unheralded heroes of the post- revolutionary period",0
1,Just compare Tunisia and its president with the situation in Egypt,0
5,"Abdel Basset Hassan, head of the Arab Institute for Human Rights in Tunis and a long-time resident of Cairo, explained to mewhenwe met in September,human rights are clearly being institutionalised to a strong degree",2
1,The problem isthat human rights is a frail political discourse,0
1,"Whetherin the most ""advanced"" democracies like the United States and UK, or developing countries like Egypt and Tunisia,it's easily swept aside by appeals to core national and/or religious identities and the creation of threats",0
1,whose defeatinevitably requireswatering down the protections afforded to all citizens,0
1,"More broadly, human rights exists in a contradictory political framework",0
1,"In most societies they both require revolutionary changeto be fully implementedand yet are routinely violated in revolutionary situationswhereone form of power is, more or less violently,overpowering and superseding another",0
1,"Asrevolutions from Iran to Cuba have shown,its all too easy for revolutions fought in the name of human rights, justice and dignityto themselves produce violent and repressive systems",0
1,human rights is intimately tied to a notion of individual personhoodthat can all too easily be hijacked to a kind of market fundamentalist liberalism,0
1,"in which broad political freedom masks incredibly deep and destruction inequalities, exploitation, and repression - whether of colonised peoples ""outremer""or ofworking classes at home",0
1," for anyonewho's experienced the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions in action,the power and importance of human rights is undeniable",0
1,"It remains one of the most radical concepts of the modern era; first,becauseit demandsrecognising othersasinherently equalto oneself regardless of their differences- ethnic, racial, gender, religion, class, or nation",0
1, they demand strict limitation on state power,0
1,"which is inherentlyand,unlesschecked,normatively abusive of citizens",0
1,And this iswherethe situation in Tunisia remains perilous despite the smooth parliamentary and presidential elections of the last two months,0
1,Marzouki's Congress for the Republic party represents a poorer and more traditional (and southern) component of Tunisian society,0
1,"Essebsi's Nida Tounes Party is not merely tied to the old regime, but to the international financial intereststo which it was beholden",0
1," the main threat in Tunisia today, in this regard, is not a religious-secular divide but left-neoliberal, with the two powerful parties working togetherto suppress all opposition toonce again makingTunisia the Arab world's ""poster child"" for a ""broken down""neoliberal reform model",0
1,which has always produced- and masked - the desperate inequalitiesthat led to the revolution against Ben Ali in the first place,0
1,"For decades, neoliberalism has produced the same results most everywhereit has been implemented: aggregate growth that mask growing inequality, increasing corruption, crime, environmental degradation and repression",0
1,"The only check on such policies would be a strong and united left (the opposite of the present situation, by some accounts) centred broadly on labour rights, a fair distribution of wealth and resources and fighting against the corruptionthat fatally weakened the previous state",0
1,"But one of the signature strengths of neoliberal ideologies, from Kansas to Cairo, isprecisely how efficientlythey motivatepeople to support leaders and policiesthat are manifestly against their economic interests",0
1,A Nida Tounes-Nahda alignment would provide a powerful ideological and political cover forretrenching the policiesthat brought Tunisia to the brink of revolution,0
1,", there are more positive countervailing forces at work in Tunisthat are cause for long-term hope",0
0,"This process is exemplified by the establishment of Dar Essaida, or Saida House, a human rights centre located in and emerging from the local community in one of Tunis' poorest quarters",2
5,"AsHassan explained,encouraging the poor and working classto(re)define the political and cultural discourses of human rights in waysthat reflect their struggles and desiresmarks an important moment in the evolution of human rights practice",2
5,"""It'saboutimplementing a complete vision,andasimportant,getting it out to the widest public,""Hassan declared",2
5,"""This is the only wayto strengthen advances in areas such as women's rights or constitutional reforms",2
5,the culture is harderto change,2
5,"you can't just root out all the networks of the former mafia state in one year, or even ten",2
5,It's a long process,2
5,"it's not fruitfulto use the angle of 'better or worse'to judge it now.""",2

0,"By all accounts, the shoot there was difficult, with unseasonal rainstorms slowing production and sandstormsblitzing the complicated props",2

0,the props and sets left behind from both shoots remaina tourist draw to this day,2

1,2014 has been worse,0

1,Will the Muslim world be ableto pull itself up from this low or enter into long-term anarchy?,0
1,"The fundamental reason behind this shameful situation in many Muslim countries is clearly the failure of political leadership, exacerbated by the sheepish role of the religious scholars and an absence of a strong civil society",0
1,Islam is still central to Muslim life,0
1,"it once shaped Muslims into a successful global community - an ""ummah"" of purpose - with a few core beliefs, values and deeds for the good of all",0
1,"In spite of many pitfalls, sometimes big, Muslims succeeded inbuilding a civilisationthat upheld universal human values,blended with the Islamic principles of pluralism",0
1," with an increasing knowledge deficit over centuries, the Muslim social and spiritual capitals were dwindling",0
1,"Astheir individual life was losing the spark of faith and positive action,their public life or political leadership was taken over by people of lower moral clarity and spiritual strength",0

1,"The collapse of politics in Iraq and Syria in recent years set off a ruthless proxy war in these historic lands, with the destruction of infrastructure and an unprecedented refugee crisis",0
1,"The rise of ISIL and its alluring attraction of young recruits from around the world, including from Muslim minority countries, has raised global Islamophobia to a new level",0
2,Politicians are meantto act in the interests of their people,2
1,It is not only their civic dutybutfor a Muslim politician it is their Islamic obligation as well,0
1,"No matterwhattheir background is,they should work with fellow politicians with grace and a team ethos - as co-citizens and co-religionists, not as enemies to one another",0

1,Islam is indeed very broad and has the abilityto accommodate anyone and everyone,0
1,"So, the difference between a Muslim secularist and an Islamist is a matter of degree",0

1,Hollywood is not necessarily less culturally sensitive than other film industries,0
1,the latter could afford big names from the former,0
1,they would probably hire them,0
1,That isbecauseaudiences worldwide are more receptive to internationally recognisable stars(even ifthey are from minority groups)than relatively unknown local or regional actors,0

0,"Some years ago the former CEO of Intel Corporation, Andy Grove, testified before the Senate urging continuation of the generous tax credits given to computer companies like Cisco, Microsoft, Google, and Apple",2
0,"These are companies with staggering profit margins,year after year",2
5,Grove was candidwhenhe told the Senatorsthat his industry was not very eagerto spend moneyto do basic research,2
5,"Whatthese companies do,he noted,is apply the research to their products and services",2
5,He called on the governmentto take this responsibility byextending tax credits (big checks) from the Treasuryto paycompanies to do such basic work,2
1,The unfairness of all these giveaways is inducing a Left-Right alliancethat opposes such giveaways,0
0,The Left calls this corporate welfare,2
0,the Right callsit crony capitalism,2
1,"Thus far, the politicians from both the Democratic and the Republican parties have not wantedto make these giveaways debatable issues in their electoral campaigns or the subject of thorough congressional or state legislative hearings",0
1,The time is coming for a Left-Right public coalitionto go operational and exert political demands for reform of this gigantic largesse,0
1,"many other necessities of the people are subjected to cruel, austere cutbacks",0
1,"""A Love Supreme"" is widely recognised as John Coltrane's masterwork, and a milestone recording in the history of jazz",0
1,Many an aficionado came to jazz through that classic album-a 32-minute-long composition organised around a four-note bass routine,0
1,The manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's treasures,0
0,the saxophonethat Coltrane usedto record the piecewas recently gifted to the Smithsonian Museum,2
1,"former US President Bill Clinton, a saxophonist and Coltrane fan, is saidto have ""A Love Supreme"" set as the ringtone forwhenHillary calls",0
0,"This week marks the 50th anniversary of ""A Love Supreme"" ",2
1,"Recorded on December 9, 1964,the composition is being celebrated worldwide in concerts, festivals, academic symposia and even at churches",0
0,"The Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church - founded in 1969 by two clericswho sawColtrane perform live in the San Francisco, and experienced a ""sound baptism""- celebrated ""A Love Supreme"" mass on December 8, in San Francisco's iconic Grace Cathedral",2
1,"The recording has long been understoodto be a deeply spiritual, even devotional, piece",0
1,"Its four phases - ""Acknowledgement"", ""Resolution"", ""Pursuance"" and ""Psalms"" - reflectwhatColtrane described as a ""spiritual awakening"" in his overcoming of drug and alcohol problems",0
1,All praise belongs to God,0
1," what was the nature of that ""spiritual awakening""?",0
1,"The conventional view isthat by 1964, Coltrane had moved away from his Methodist upbringing,adopting a ""pan-religious"" outlook with a particular interest in Eastern mysticism",0
1,"""A Love Supreme"" is still described as laden with Biblical symbolism: the title ""Psalm"",andthe rising cadences, reminiscent of black preachers' style, are offered as evidencethat Coltrane was still rooted in Christianity",0
1,"ask one of the jazzmen or Muslim elderswho knew Coltrane,andyou get a different answer",0
0,"The saxophonist Yusef Lateef,who died at the age of 93 earlier this year,worked closely with Coltrane between 1963 and 1966",2
5,"In his autobiography , ""A Gentle Giant"", Lateef says:""The prayerthat John wrote in 'A Love Supreme'repeats the phrase 'Allpraise belongs to God no matter what'several times",2
2,"This phrase has the semantics of the al-Fatiha,which is the first chapter or sura of the Holy Quran",2
2,The Arabic transliteration is 'al-Humdulilah,2
5,"Sinceall faithful Muslims say the al-Fatiha five times a day or more,it is reasonableto assumethat John heard this phrase from [his Muslim wife] Sister Naima many times.""",2
1,Lateef is referring to the poemColtrane wrote and included in the liner notes of the album,0
5,"Coltrane wrote:""No matter what...It is with God.He is gracious and merciful"" and ends with ""All praise to God...""",2
1,"WhatLateef and others have notedisthat ""gracious and merciful"" is a translation of ""rahman raheem"", the opening lines of the Fatiha",0
5,"say the elders,whenColtrane beginschanting the album's title for half a minuteit sounds like a Sufi breathily repeating ""Allah supreme""",2
1,The relationship between Islam and jazz is almost a century-old,0
2,"It was in the 1920sthat the Ahmadiyya movement, a heterodox Islamic movementthat emerged in 19th century India,begansending missionaries to US cities,building a substantial following among African Americans in the decadesto come",2
1,"In a trendthat still intrigues historians and music critics,afterWorld War II,scores of jazz musicians embraced Ahmadi Islam",0
1,"WhenColtrane arrived in Philadelphia in 1943,the Muslim presence in the ""city of brotherly love"" would rattle the young man",0
5,"Ashe told an interviewer in 1958:""This Muslim thing came up.I got introduced to that.And that kind of shook me.""",2
1,The saxophonist was surrounded by Muslims,0
0,"his drummer Rashied Ali was Muslim,aswas his pianist McCoy Tyner (Suleiman Saud), and saxophonist Lateef",2
0,"Coltrane then married Naima Grubbs, an observant Muslim",2
1,Even Coltrane's band members have pondered his relationship to Islam,0
1,Lateef suspectedthat Coltrane's art was influenced by the Quran,0
5,"the drummer Rashied Ali thoughtthat the saxophonist was ""a real country boy""andthat ""he was intobeing a Muslim and everything like that""",2
5,"""Backthenjazz and Islam were intertwined - the first timeI heard the adhan on Temple University radio,I thoughtit was a Nina Simone song,""says Imam Nadim Ali, a celebrated jazz deejay and community leader",2
2,who spent his youth in Philadelphia,2
5,"""Artists were deeply influenced by Islam - sometimes publicly in their art, sometimes privately.""",2
1,"It's not inconceivablethat ""A Love Supreme"" could have been inspired by the Quran",0
1,"asthe elders will observe,""Celebration"",that great funk hit by Kool & the Gang,was inspired by a Quranic sura",0
5,"""Theinitial idea came from the Quran,""says Ronald Bell (Khalis Bayyan), the group's saxophonist and musical arranger",2
5,"""Iwas reading the passage,whereGod was creating Adam,andthe angels were celebrating and singing praises",2
5,"That inspiredme to write the basic chords, the line, 'Everyone around the world, come on, celebration'.""",2
0,"This song inspired by Islam - and released in 1980 - would become an international hit heard at ball games and political rallies in the US,andironically was played by the Reagan administration on February 7, 1981,to welcome homethe hostages held by students in the Islamic Republic of Iran",2
0,"One also hears the argumentthat Coltrane wantedto titlehis composition ""Allah Supreme""- instead of ""A Love Supreme"" - but was worried about a political backlash, given the ongoing conflict in the Middle East",2
1,The mass conversion of African Americans to Islam unsettled many European Americans and tensions rippled into the jazz world,0
1,"Jazz critics would often dismiss the converts as ""strange"" and ""confused""",0
1,"In his memoir, Dizzy Gillespie candidly describes the pressuresthat faced young converts in the jazz world",0
5,"""Themovement among jazz musicians towards Islam createdquite a stir, especially with the surge of the Zionist movement,""writes Dizzy Gillespie in""To Be or Not to Bop""",2
5,"""A lot of friction arose between Jews and Muslims,which took the form of a semi-boycott in New York of jazz musicians with Muslim names...Near the end of the '40s, the newspapers really got worried aboutwhetherI'd convert to Islam.""",2
5,"Gillespie was,ashe would say,""intrigued"" by ""the beautiful sound of the word Quran and discussed Islam extensively with Lateef",2
0,"But in 1948, in a shoot for a feature story with Life magazine, Gillespie was askedto pose shirtless, cross-legged, and bowing with his arms outstretched",2
5,The magazine published the piece and claimed (falsely)that the trumpeter was bowing in prayer towards Mecca,2
5,"The media ruckusthat ensued about the King of Bebop's abandonment of Christianity incensed Gillespie.He would eventually become a Bahai.""",2
1,Political and racial pressures still bear heavily on black and Muslim artists (especially hip hop artists) today,0
1,And we may never knowwhatColtrane had in mindwhenhe composed his masterpiece,0
1,"asthe US celebrates and and tries to mainstream figures from the turbulent 1960s, voices from the communitiesthat produced the likes of Coltrane, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali,should be heard - especially as the domestic and foreign policiesthat pushedAfrican Americans towards Islam a century ago are still with us",0
0,Hisham Aidi teaches at Columbia University,2
0,"He is the author of the critically acclaimed Rebel Music: Race, Empire and the New Muslim Youth Culture, a study of black internationalism and global youth culture",2
1,There are many unanswered questions about the TTP,0
1,How bigis the group?,0
1,"Have its ties to the Pakistani intelligence agencies become strongersinceMullah Fazlullah, of Swat fame, became its leader, given his own past affiliation with Pakistan's powerful spy agency ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)?",0
1,Or is the group closer now to other foreign funders?,0
1,The absence ofconvincing answers to such questionshas resulted in ongoing debates on the appropriate response to this horror,0
1,"FromUS-backed media personalities supporting the establishment of concentration camps for entire populations in some parts of the tribal areas, to the broadening of ongoing military operationsthe overwhelming thrust among many vocal commentators has been forcountering this violence with more violence",0
1, there is also a deep scepticism about a primarily military response within the Pakistani society,0
1,which iswhysuccessive governments have been secretive about such operations,0
1,"Despite repeated calls for stronger military action by the US government and also many influential commentators within Pakistan, there is widespread suspicionthat these army operations end upkilling more civilians than militants",0
1,"It is easy, but completely misleading,to write off this widespread scepticism about military responses to the Taliban violenceasdriven by sympathetic sentiments or worse",0
1,the inability of Pakistanis to face the hard facts of home-grown terror,0
1,We must recognisethat it is a mistrust borne of experience with the military's role in Pakistani politics,0
1,"we needto recognise the long-term impact of the Pakistani state's support for the ""war on terror"" and its operations in the tribal areas over the last decade",0
1,There is a growing sense of deprivation and discrimination among Pashtuns across the country,0
1,further state violence in the region hasto be carefully weighed against the very real possibility of serious backlash,0
1,we all agreethat there must be a response to these atrocities,0
1,"forit to be effective,both at the state and societal levelit is imperativethat it is calibrated to the level of threat posed by wide range of groups contained within the category ""Taliban""",0
1,"All four are a direct result of the chaos created by the US' war in the region and the supply of drugs, arms and menthat such a war invariably engenders",0
1,But these four groups all require different responses,0
1,The local defence militias can be ignored for now,0
1,The mercenaries and criminals needto be treated precisely as that,0
1,"controlling and managing their sources of incomes or in some cases, completely eroding them",0
1, the first two groups require a much broader and more complex response,0
1,"There is, unfortunately, no short-cut to political transparencythat is required for their dismantling",0
1,"Aggressive and persistent public questioning and scrutiny of Pakistani generals and politicians associated with the state funded militia, as well as their support for the ""war on terror"" in the region,is the only viable strategy available to citizens of Pakistan for a lasting resolution",0
1,"In this context, the religious vs secular binary is completely artificial",0
1,The most secular generals of the Pakistani army have been happyto support some versions of Taliban as well as to benefit financially and politically bysupporting the US war in the region,0
1,A key step in this direction hasto be the demand for greater information about the militantswho attacked the school in Peshawar,0
0,AlthoughTTP has claimed responsibility for the tragedy,2
1,it is importantto establishwho precisely is involved,0
1,Howdid they get past the three check points in the defence colonywherethe school is located?,0
1,Which cities/villagesdid the militantswho were killedcome from?,0
1,Howdoes that correspond to the profiles of the attackers in the past?,0
1,Whereis that information about past attackers anyway?,0
1,Whatare their organisational careers and educational backgrounds?,0
1,Whereare their families,0
1,whatcan they tell us about the paththeir sons took?,0
1,"Calling on the very same generalsto carry out military operations against the operativesthey have supported and createdis surely a strategy fraught with contradictions, though favoured by some vocal analysts and by the US government",0
1,"The collective punishment of the people of the tribal areas as a ""solution"" may appeal to some because of its deceptive simplicity",0
1,it is an extremely dangerous strategy likelyto further shred the fabric of Pakistani public life,0
1,There are a whole bunch of peoplewho simply don't like Christmas and are fightingto get rid of it any waythey can,0
1,"And, there are a lot of people on the other sidewho are angry at those efforts",0
1,"And so, this whole battle overwhetherto say Christmas or Happy Holidaysmisses the point",0
1,I supposeit may be hardto be a non-believer in the religious themes around Christmas and live in our culture,0
1,"You are confronted daily with the religious symbolism of Christmas in the booksyou read,the friendsyou haveand the moviesyou watch",0
1, you haveto stay away from religious stuff...like Christmas celebrations,0
1,"I'm a believer, but not without a modicum of compassion for thosewho don't share my religious beliefs",0
1,I can imaginehowirritating Christmas must be for thosewhose whole worldview is built on the beliefthat Christmas doesn't matterbecauseit points towhatis spurious at best and dangerous at worst,0
1,"I get that, too",0
0,"I must admit, though,that I getirritated sometimeswhena group of people bringa lawsuit to get rid of the town creche",2
0,"whensomeone wishesme ""Happy Holidays.""",2
0,It bothers mewhenuniversities remove Christmas trees,2
1,Christmas concerts are canceledbecauseit offends thosewho aren't religious or Christian,0
0,"Frankly, I listen to a lot of stuff from the other side all the time",2
1,Fair play suggeststhat it wouldn't hurt for the other sideto abide some of mine,0
0,I decidedthat I'm just not goingto fight the Christmas war,2
1,I'm an old guy,0
1,old people are already irritated aboutbeing old,0
1,"Assomeone said,it takes very littleto tick us off",0
0,"Instead, I'm just goingto sing as loudly and as publiclyasI cana Christmas carol---a Christmas carol about love and a God",2
1,who went to a lot of troubleto express his love for us,0
1,"in my belief system, Christmas doesn't meanthat God cameto destroy us or to kick posteriors",0
1,I believethat the reasonhe camewasto tell usthat he isn't angry,0
1,"whenwe make obscene gestures or get mean with thosewho disagree with us,it kind of misses the point",0
1,It becomes a disconnect betweenwhatI believeandwhatI do,0
1,I really believe(and I do)that the King came,0
1,it kind of changes my perspective,0
0,I have a friendwhose familytakesplaying chess very seriously,2
0,"It gets so ""hot""sometimes that they end upthrowing chess pieces at one another",2
1,you can imagine,0
1,they lose a lot of pieces,0
0,"One Christmaswhenthey were playing chess,my friend took the baby Jesus from the small creche under the Christmas treeto replace one of his lost pieces",2
0,"My friend then beganto move all over the board,going after his brother's pieces",2

1,Jesus doesashe pleases,0
1,he does it right well,0

5,"""TheLondon Conference on Afghanistan will provide an opportunity for the government of Afghanistanto set out its commitmentto reform,""states the UK government's official webpage of the upcoming meeting between the new Afghan government and its international donors",2
5,"The conference isalso an opportunity for the international community ""to reaffirm its long-term commitment tosupporting Afghanistan's peaceful development""",2
1,"Despite the media hype, the London Conference is nothing more than a routine reunion, set by the 2012 Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF)",0
0,"As part of the agreement, donors pledgedsupport and the Afghan government promisedto implement reforms and curb corruption",2
0,"The upcoming meeting in the British capital, therefore, is the first in a series of exchangesthat will be held every two years, at the ministerial level, between the Afghan and donor governmentsto assess progress and check TMAF's benchmarks",2
1, the December 4 conference has the potentialto ease Afghanistan into a stable and increasingly self-sufficient future and render it a reliable global partner forensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,0
1,To utilise this opportunity as more than aroutine progress assessment requires a fundamental shift of attitude on both sides,0
1,"Lack of concrete success in the military, economic development and governance efforts in post-Taliban Afghanistan needsto be sincerely examined",0
1,adjustments needto be made,0
1,"There is multitude of examples in the international community's flawed, if not disingenuous, aid programmes and their monitoring in Afghanistan",0
0,I was hired by a US consultancy firmto map out the field and offer recommendations for the design of a multimillion dollar governance project,2
0,"My report and recommendations,it turned out,were too radical",2
0,"""Weexpected recommendations for cosmetic changes to the ongoing programmes,""I was told",2
0,"""The donor agency does not wantto rock the boat.""",2
0,"On another occasion, I was interviewed by a European consultant for his assessment of the first phase of a programmethat had consistently been showcased as a ""success story"" by donors and the Afghan government",2
0,"In his three-day field trip to Kabul, he had held meetings with three embassies, the UN, the Afghan head of the implementing agency and me",2
0,"Eagerly, I beganto point to the flaws of the programmeand offered suggestions for improvement",2
0,I also offered assistance for site visits,2
0,"""Don't waste your time and mine,""the septuagenarian consultant told me",2
0,"""The donor agency expects a rosy report highlighting only the positive.""",2
0,"He further clarifiedthat the decisionto fund the second phasehad already been madeandit had moreto do with international aid politics, than development logic",2
2,Numbers providean easy way to illustrate success,2
1,especially whenseeking international aid budget approval from legislative bodies,0
1,Whilefigures indicating Afghanistan's progress towards development are impressive and could not have been achieved without generous international assistance,0
1,they conceal a lack of attention to quality,0
4,About 8 million Afghan children - including over 2.5 million girls - are now in school,2
0,This is a figure cited regularly as an indicationthat the programmes are yielding tangible results,2
1,The factthat most of them graduate only half-literateis never revealed,0
1,Here's another feel-good figure,0
4,More than 60 percent of the Afghan population now has access to healthcare facilities,2
1,"The factthat some of those facilities have only received a checkmarkbecausemerely a building was constructedandmany are staffed only with a nurse, have no diagnostic technology and have terribly anaemic pharmaceutical offeringsis often ignored",0
1,Much has been written about the factthat a hefty portion of the aid money goes back to donor countries because of the donors' insistence to award contracts to their own citizens,0
0,The contracts move hand to hand,2
0,finally local non-governmental agencies are hiredto implement projects,2
1,"whileat best one-quarter of the original funds remainsto be spent on the actual project,quality is grossly compromised",0
1,monitoring becomeseither too complex or irrelevant,0
1,The international community has also created an indigenous vehicle for channelling portions of its assistance,0
1,"Under the guise of ""civil society"", hundreds of Afghan NGOs have been established since 2002",0
1,This artificial civil society's lifeline is the donor community in Kabul,0
1,"Projects and funds are handed to them for implementation and as the closing of fiscal year in donor capitals approaches, generosity in disbursing funds, irrespective of the projects' logic, utility and cost increases",0
1,"Grantedthat wheninternational aid beganto pour in,the Afghan state had very small,ifany,capacityto absorb and spend it",0
1," after 13 years and millions of dollars spent on public sector capacity building, the bulk of the funds continueto be spent directly by donors",0
4,only a little over 20 percent is given to the Afghan government,2
1,The parallel system and structures offering higher salaries paid in US dollars have lured much of the skilled Afghan human resources,0
1,"The Afghan administration, thus, hasto be grateful to donors for funding training workshops,whilein the end, loses its best trained personnel to international organisations, consulting firms and embassies",0
0,It is often saidthat rampant Afghan corruption and lack of capacity would result in misuse and waste of donors' funds,2
4,"A mere review of reports published by the US oversight agency, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), reveals the depth and extent of waste, fraud and abuse of the direct US aid to Afghanistan just in reconstruction projects",2
1,"Similar monitoring of most donors' direct aid will, no doubt, highlight comparable corruption and waste",0
1,The government of former President Hamid Karzai admittedly failedto launch a genuine fight against corruption,0
1,Lack of capacity for a governance visionthat would make optimum use of international aidwas also a defect of the previous leadership,0
1,"High-level appointments were based not on competence and commitment of individuals, but rather on political affiliations and compromises on the one hand, and submissiveness of a handful of ""yes sir"" entities on the other",0
1, both sides - donors and the Afghan government - went on for a decadeplaying a futile blame game,0
1,each accusing the other of corruption and insincerity,0
1," on the eve of the London Conference, a new page has turned in Afghanistan's leadership and governance",0
1,The level of optimism among ordinary Afghans is only comparable to the euphoria of the first weeks following the fall of the Taliban regime,0
1,This renewed domestic hope and confidence in the new leadership must not be letto deflate,0
0,Althoughthe new administration has not yet launched its overhauling programme,2
1,President Ashraf Ghani's vision and capacity is well known,0
1,Donors at the London Conference must seize the chance and afford him confidence,0
1,They must also adapt a fundamentally new approach todispensing their generous assistance to Afghanistan,0
1,"A significant funnelling of international aid through the Afghan government (with oversight and accountability benchmarks), a shift of emphasis from quantity to quality, with particular focus onraising the quality of education and finally,a sincere commitment from both sides to the establishment of rule of law will ensure the stability and eventual self-reliance of Afghanistan",0

1,retailers are starting their after-Christmas sales earlier than ever,0
1,just as the Christmas shopping season startsbeforeyou get to Thanksgiving dessert,0
1,seasoned shoppers know(1) valueand(2) bargain do not mean the same thing,0
2,"We all knowjust becausesomething is cheapdoesn't meanit's ""a bargain"" or a ""value.""",2
1,"It's only a bargainifit is truly somethingyou want or need,and are ableto get it at a deep discount",0
1,Often last minute shoppers don't knowwhatthey want,0
1,For those shopping this weekend you will haveto settle forwhatcircumstances present,0
1,"which in many cases will be cheap materials, but not a bargains",0
2,The value is the ratio of quality (or quantity)to price,2
1,Low quality at a low price is no value,0
2,especially whencompared to high quality at a low price,2
1,Values tend go early in the holiday shopping season,0
1,Cheap stays on the shelfuntilit's allthat's left,0
1,Believe there is still moneyto spend in your budget this month,0
1,"Last minute shopping, particularly for December, meansbuying during the back half of the month",0
1,That's typicallywhenmost income for the month is already committed,0

2,"Nobody likesthat ""January surprise.""",2
1,"And for new last- minute shoppers, that surprise can be surprisingly BIG!",0
1,"Believe you can still find ""just the right gift for Uncle George.""",0
1,Waiting until the last minute to shopmeanshavingto make compromises,0

1,"At this stage in the game, a gift will do",0
1,"Believe you still need ""just one more"" gift",0
1,We should all take a lesson out of Santa's playbook: 1.Make a list.2.Check it twice,0
1,Too often last minute shopping isn't just an indicationyou've waited to the bitter endto buy those needed gifts,0
1,It also meansyou've waited too longto plan that shopping,0
1,whenthat happensyou're never quite sureifyou have all the giftsyou need,0

1,"By the way, that'swhenshoppers are especially susceptible to impulse buying",0
1,An attention-arresting display will attract last minute shopperslikehoney attracts flies!,0
1,Believethat the shopper has the advantage,0
1,it is truethat the Saturday before Christmas is still one of the busiest shopping days of the year,0
1,the advantage has swung back in favor of the retailer,0
1,"With fewer hoursto shopuntilSanta fills his sack,the retailer has the upper hand",0
1,especially ifthey've had a strong Q4,0
1,"For some,shopping the weekend before Christmascan bring the ultimate sense of that holiday experience",0
1,"For thosewho enjoy shopping as a pastime,it's one of the best timesto be in the mall",0
1,"for those folkswho needto fulfill a shopping list,it can be one of the worst",0

1,Let's faceit,0
1,a party gets 25 percent in the national vote,0
1,likethe National Front did in the European elections this year,0
1,it meansthat a lot of people see it as a better bet than the other parties,0

0,One of us is pro-choiceandthe other is pro-life,2
1,"we both believethat the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) properly requiresthat pregnant employees like Peggy Young, a former UPS workerwhose caseis being heard by the U.S  Supreme Court,be treated the same as other workerswho are similarly limited in their abilityto perform certain tasks at work",0

5,"In orderto reinforcethat the origin of the employees' limitation must not control,the 2014 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines further clarifythat ""an employer may not refuseto treat a pregnant worker the same as other employeeswho are similar in their ability or inabilityto work byrelying on a policythat makes distinctions based on the source of an employee's limitations.""",2

1,Both sides agreedthat employers should not be ableto push a woman out of the workforceand potentially even into povertybased on pregnancy,0
1,"The PDA was meantto ensurethat a pregnant woman should not haveto choose between the health--or existence---of her pregnancy, and her abilityto participate in, and derive economic stability for herself and her family from,the workplace",0
1,Young's scenario is exactly thatwhich the PDA soughtto address,0
0,"For close to 10 years, Young worked at UPS in Landover, Maryland as an early morning air driver",2
0,"Whenshe became pregnant,her midwife recommendedthat she lift no more than 20 pounds during her pregnancy",2
0,"UPS already allowed a wide range of people with physical limitationsto work light duty,including workers injured on the job, workers protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and others with a wide variety of medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, vision or hearing problems, limb impairments, sleep apnea and emotional problems",2
0,"Citing union restrictions,UPS refusedto give a similar accommodation to Young",2
0,"As a result, Young and her family lost her pay and insurance benefits for the remainder of her pregnancy",2
1,We reject this treatment asnot just illegal but immoral,0
0,UPS recently changed their policyto add pregnant women to the list of those allowedto work light duty,2
0,(the union did not in fact prevent UPS fromchanging its policy),2
1,they still arguethat the PDA does not requirethem to give this accommodation to Young,0

1,The instability and chaos sweeping across the Arab world today represents both a threat and an opportunity for Iran,0
1,"Instability in Yemen, Libya, Syria and Iraq are case-in-point examplesthat Iran can realise its short and long-term objectivesto become the region's main hegemon",0
1,"Surrounded by countries with significant Shia minorities,Iran seeksto cultivate the image of ""protector state"" for these populations",0
1,"And eventually, Iran could become the ""core country"" in this hotly contested region",0
1,"Toward this end, Iran has stirred Shia-Sunni divisions,creating sectarian identities for the various clashing groups",0
1,"In the case of Yemen, this was done within the borders of one country",0
1,Iran contrived to create a distinct Shia identity for the Houthis,0
1,who ended uptaking control over the course of the past few months,0
1,"The Iranian strategy is focused onbuilding a new political model in the region - onethat relies on Iran's ""centrality""through which it can exercise power and influence both on the regional and international levels",0
1,"Especially after the election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Iran has been keento develop working relations with the West and the US (particularly with regard to ""fighting terrorism"" -asit had done before in Afghanistan)",0
1,It is also eagerto play a similar role in Iraq,0
1,"This Iranian eagerness, however, cannot be isolated from the larger vision",0
1,"This vision sees such cooperation asadvancing the Iranian model ofemphasising its geopolitical centrality for Shiism,as well as its hegemonic desires over the region, including the Arab Sunni states",0
1,"To become the centre of gravity of the Middle East,Iran needsto amplify its role as both a protector and hegemon for its much weaker and unstable Arab neighbours",0
1,These neighbours would be relegated within the Iranian model to the status of periphery states,0
1,"To do that,Iran usesits old revolutionary rhetoric and slogans to describe its brand of Islam as ""authentic and original""whiledescribing pro-West Sunni Arab states ashaving an ""American-Islam""",0
1,which it presents as an illegitimate form of Islam,0
0,"In his Washington Post op-ed last September, ""Time to Engage"", Rouhani outlined the Iranian objectives and the key areasin which Iran can cooperate with the US and the West",2
0,AlthoughRouhani laid out the Iranian strategic perspective and the parametersthrough which Iran can work and cooperate with the West,2
1,"there was an important point,which he left unsaid",0
1,"He was essentially sayingthat the US must recognise the failure of its old policies, especially in the region, and at the same time tacitly acknowledgedthat Iran had made mistakes indealing with the US during the past eight years",0
1," he opened the door for US-Iranian cooperation oncombating terrorismand emphasised the Iranian role insolving the region's thorniest problems, such as the Palestinian cause and the conflict with Israel",0
1,"Current Iranian discourse - political and cultural - revolves aroundadvancing the view of superiority of the Iranian race, Shia Islam, and Iranian culture",0
1,"Such discourse focuses on the uniqueness of the Iranian race as onethat is steeped in civilisation, juxtaposed with the Arabswho represent,according to this view, the ""other"", i.e  less civilised",0
1,"In realpolitik terms, amid the instability and chaos plaguing Arab states, Iran presents itself as the alternative powerto fill the vacuum in the region",0
1,"From the Iranian perspective,the US has failedto solve many of the international crises",0
1,"in some cases, it has created them",0
1,"Iran, in this respect, is positioning itself as a rising powerthat will replace the US as the dominant power in the region",0
5,"Echoing such discourse,Kazem Sajjadpour, an advisor on Strategic Affairs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran said, in Persian, during his participation in the roundtable discussion on the website Shia News Association,that whilethe Arab world suffers from fragmentation and strategic paralysis -whileunder the influence of western powers-Iran enjoys territorial integrity and cohesiveness, and is endowed with strategic resources",2
1,All of these are factorsthat could makeIran the new rising power in the region,0
1, Iran is making the casethat the entire Arab world revolves around it - and cannot survive without it,0
1,"It's wonderful (anda good thing)to see the new emphasis on""giving overreceiving"" at Christmas time",0
1,It's become a trend this year with so many families,0
2,becauseas parents we wantto teach kids about generosity,2
1,Moms and dads everywhere are using Christmas as an opportunityto get their kidsthinking aboutserving others and giving to the less fortunate,0
1,rather than encouragingthem to create monstrous Christmas listsdescribing all the thingsthey want this season,0
0,"Some parents are even ""cancelling"" Christmas for their kids,not giving any family members any gifts",2
1,do we really needto cancel Christmas in orderto foster a spirit of generosity in our kids?,0
0,"Wednesday I joined Lisa Henderson on ""Fox & Friends""to debate this very question",2
0,"Lisa has ""cancelled Christmas"" in her Utah home",2
5,"she says,her kids have become too entitled,""acting so ungrateful"" and ""extremely disrespectful.""",2
0,So there will be no presents for Christmas,2
5,"asshe writes on her blog Overthebigmooon.com,""There is a good possibilitythat Santa will be writingthem a letter ofhow proud of themhe is and perhaps put a few pieces of hard candy and an orange in their stockings.""",2
1,WhileI have great respect forwhatLisa wantsto accomplish,0
1,I disagree with her approach,0
1,"Christmas should begin, not end, at home",0
1,We are already under immense pressureto purge Christmas from our culture,0

1,"Even saying""Merry Christmas"" has taken a back seat to ""Happy Holidays.""",0
1,Cancelling Christmas and using letters from Santato motivate our kidsto be generousis not the answer,0
1,The answer is inputting the emphasis on the miracle not the material,0
1,And here's the good news,0
1,Even our gift giving can point to the miracle,0
1,"So, yes, we give a few gifts to our kids",0
1,But we also give many gifts to the less fortunate,0
0, we've taught our own kidsthat the giftswe give them at Christmasaren't based onwhetherthey've been bad or good all year,2
1,"The giftswe givethem are free,unearned, underserved gifts",0
1,"just likethe gift of Jesus is a free, unearned, and underserved gift",0
1,"This is a very tangible, concrete concept for kidsto grasp",0
1,"whenwe serve and give to others,we teach our kidswhatJesus said in Matthew 25:40",0
5,"""Whateveryou do for the least of your brothers and sisters,you do for me.""",2
1,"So we give gifts to Jesus on his ""birthday"" byserving and loving and giving to others!",0
1,This ishowparents can infuse real meaning into Christmas -- not byrefusingto celebrate it all together,0
1,Cancelling Christmas is simply not the key tofostering generosity in our kids,0
1,The key tofostering generosity in our kidsis bymakinggiving somethingwe do all year round.Bymakingit a lifestyle,0
1,And a lifestyle ofgivingsprings from a deep well of gratitude forhowJesus first gave his life for us,0
1,"We haveto be so carefulnot to teach our kidsthat Christmas is aboutdoing more, trying harder, and being betterto be worthy of gifts",0
1,Christmas is aboutanticipating and celebrating the greatest giftthat has already been given-- the unconditional love of God in the birth of Jesus Christ,0
1,"Our focus shouldn't be onwhether or notwe have a tree overflowing with gifts, but onwhetherwe have a home overflowing with love",0

1,"How precious in the sight of progressiveswas one of their saints, Mario Cuomo, the three-term governor of New Yorkwho died last week at age 82",0
1,He was a model of progressivism and a gifted rhetorician,0
0,"In most media accounts, references were made to two speeches Cuomo delivered in 1984, one at the Democratic National Convention in San FranciscowhereWalter Mondale was nominated for president,and the other at the University of Notre DamewhereCuomo spoke about abortion and the ""proper"" role of religion in politics",2
1,The thing about progressivism isthat it resembles floor wax -- all shine and no depth,0
0,"In his Democratic convention speech, Cuomo referenced Ronald Reagan's line aboutAmerica being a ""shining city on a hill.""",2
5,"Cuomo responded,""A shining cityis perhaps all the presidentsees from the portico of the White House or the veranda of his ranch,whereeveryone seemsto be doing well",2
5,"But there's another city;there's another part to the shining city....In this part of the city, there are more poor than ever",2
5,More families in trouble,2
5,More and more peoplewho need help but can'tfind it,2
5,"...There are peoplewho sleep in the city streets, in the gutterwherethe glitter doesn't show.""",2
1,This is boilerplate Democratic rhetoricwe've heard since the days of Franklin Roosevelt,0
1,"After Democrats Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama,are fewer families in trouble?",0
1,"Are there fewer poor people, especially since Johnson's ""War on Poverty"" promisedto end it?",0
1,Statistics revealthere are not,0
1,sowhydosomany embrace progressive ideas?,0
1,something isn't working,0
1,whyrepeat the errors?,0
1,"AsReagan noted,government too often adds to problems",0
1,it doesn't solve them,0
1,Government doesn't create jobs,0
1,a thriving private economy does,0
1,"Government welfare mostly doesn't incentivize peopleto escape poverty,but too often sustains them in poverty and addicts them to government handouts",0
1,"On the issue of church and state, Cuomo bisected the subjects in his Notre Dame speech",0
5,he saidhe accepted Catholic teaching against capital punishment,2
0,he rejected its opposition to abortion,2
0,"In this, the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin expressed opposition to both issueswhile eloquently arguingthat the Catholic Church believesthat each is part of a ""seamless garment"" of lifeandthat all life matters and should not be taken by individuals, or the state",2
1,This is another flaw of progressivism,0
1,"Progressives are happyto embrace church teachingswhenit favors their political agenda, but reject themwhenthose teachingsdon't conform to their politics",0
0,"My one encounter with Cuomo cameafter a column I wrote following his 2007 debate with former Speaker Newt Gingrich at Cooper Union in New York, the site of a famous speech by Abraham Lincoln",2
0,I saidthat Gingrich clearly won the debate and made a mockery of Cuomo's liberalism,2
0,Cuomo called me and afteridentifyinghimself launched into a tiradethat lasted about 90 seconds,2
0,"He then hung upgiving me no opportunityto say much more than ""hello,niceto hear from you.""",2
1,"Most obituaries and news reports calledCuomo ""inspiring.""",0
5,"A New York Times editorial correctly noted:""For all his idealism, Mr  Cuomo's years as governor were dogged by economic recessionthat blunted his hopesto leave great programs and innovation as his legacy",2

0,"This week a court in Belgium announcedthat the convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken would be put to death by a lethal injection, in spite of the factthat the death penalty is banned across Europe",2
1,Van Den Bleeken's case was unusual,0
0,"having previously been declared insane and not criminally responsible,he had himself askedto be euthanised on the groundsthat he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in jail",2
0,"Today the Belgian justice minister announcedthat Van Den Bleeken would not be euthanised after all, amid reportsthat the prisoner had changed his mind",2
1, the case provides a fascinating twist to the old debate about euthanasia,0
0,Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowedto die?,2
1,The moral defence of voluntary euthanasia is usually applied to people suffering from a terminal illness,0
1,But Van Den Bleeken isn't terminally ill and isn't in physical pain,0
1,Another traditional requirement isthat the wishto dieshould be voluntary and competent,0
1,But howcan the choices of someonewho has been declaredinsanebe regardedas voluntary and competent?,0
1,The concern isthat granting his requestwould makeit a case of involuntary euthanasia,0
2,that is usually seen as morally unacceptable,2
1,there is an issue about Van Bleeken's sanity,0
1,that is because of his alleged inabilityto control his sexual impulses,0
1,But it could be arguedthat this doesn't affect the validity of his requestto be euthanised,0
1,"The implication isthat whilesome of his decisions might be involuntary or incompetent,this doesn't apply to his choice of death over a lifetime behind bars",0
1,"should his request have been granted,givenOne argument forallowing voluntary euthanasiawhereterminal illness isn't an issueturns on the idea of wellbeing",0
1,people should be allowedto choose deathwherethey would literally be better off deadorwheretheir life literally isn't worth living,0
1,Another argument turns on human autonomy,0
1,we should respect a person's free choices as longasthey don't harmanyone else,0
1,Someonewho is not terminally illcould still satisfy these requirements,0
1,"Had Van Den Bleeken been allowedto die,critics may sayit would have riskedopening the floodgates for other similar cases",0
4,"Belgium has seen a dramatic rise in euthanasiasincethe practice was legalised in 2002 and permitted in cases of pain and psychological distress, as well as terminal illness",2
1,Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia as a matter of principle,0
5,"The philosopher David Velleman arguesthat there isn't a fundamental rightto choose between life and death,andthat a person's rights don't expandwhenthey become terminally ill or psychologically distressed",2
1,He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant,0
5,"According to Kant,morality requiresthat we respect the dignity of persons,andthe dignity of persons makesthem intrinsically valuable",2
5,"For Kant,a person's dignity can't be traded against their wellbeing or happiness",2
5,the factthat a person believesthat their life isn't worth livingdoesn't makeit acceptableforthem to be euthanised,2
1,The Van Den Bleeken case puts pressure on these standard arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia,0
3,"Supposethat, contrary to Kant's view, voluntary euthanasia is morally permissible as longasthe person askingto be euthanisedwould be genuinely better off dead",1
1,Relatives of Van Den Bleeken's victim may well arguethat the fact(ifit is a fact)that he would be better off deadis precisely a reason fornot allowinghim to be put to death,0
1,"From this perspective, euthanasia looks like a way for himto circumvent his sentence",0
0,"Van Den Bleeken's victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-oldhe raped and strangled in 1989",2
5,Her sisters are reportedto have saidthat Van Den Bleeken should be forcedto languish in jail,2
1,their reaction brings out an ambivalence inhowwe think about the death penalty for murder,0
1,Relatives of murder victims often demand the death penalty as the ultimate punishment,0
1,"the Van Den Bleeken case suggeststhat, at least from the standpoint of the perpetrator, the ultimate sanction may be life behind bars",0
1,"But the intrinsic value argument against voluntary euthanasia can also be hardto swallow, in this case",0
1,Christiane Remacle's sisters might balk at the ideathat a murderer's life is intrinsically valuable,0
1,It's hardnot to sympathise,0
1,there remain strong reasons fornot allowingVan Den Bleeken to be euthanised regardless ofwhetherhis life is intrinsically valuable,0
1,"Aslong as euthanasia is seen as a way for himto circumvent his sentence,respect for his victim and her family demandsthat he isn't given the option",0

1,"It was the first public accounting ofwhatthat programme actually entailed, and as one of the most controversial topics in Washington, is sureto create a political firestorm on both the left and the right,not to mention around the world,for many monthsto come",0
1, it was shocking,0
1,It was ugly,0
1,It should lead no doubt to the readerthat the programme was as wrongasit was useless,0
1,And it can never be permittedto happen again,0
0,The CIA's torture programme was authorised by then President George W Bush in August 2002,2
1,"giving them broad discretion in the use of harsh interrogation techniquesthat included waterboarding, sleep deprivation, hypothermia, stress positions, abdomen strikes, slapping and forced shaking",0
1,Its stated purpose wasto solicit actionable intelligencethat might save American lives,0
1,"In effect, it gave carte blanche for interrogatorsto do pretty much anythingthey wanted from a laundry list of macabre techniquesto extract that information",0
1,"To those behind the programme, the moral question was perversely inconsequential",0
1,"asthey all too readily adopted the Machiavellian philosophy of ""the endjustifies the means""",0
0,"In methodical fashion, SSCI laid out its case through 20 findings and conclusions, followed by detailed supporting chapters tying them all together",2
1,"Nearly 500 pages in length,it was a mere, yet chilling, fraction of the overall report",0

0,afterthe torture programme was authorised,2
0,"he was subjected to numerous and repeated torture techniques,to includebeing waterboarded 83 times",2

1,There's only one problem with that story,0
1,It wasn't true,0
5,"According to the SSCI report, the FBI actually obtained that information from Zubaydah through legal interrogation techniques between March and June 2002, and provided it to the CIA monthsbeforehe was ever subjected to waterboarding or any other torture techniques",2

1,Maybe Zubaydah repeated that information as a result of waterboarding,0
1,the official record reflectsthat it certainly wasn't the first timethe CIA ever heard about it,0
1,"And that's pretty much itwhenit comes to ""actionable intelligence"" gained through the CIA's use of torture",0
3,Seriously?,1
1,But it gets worse,0
0,"Beginning with Zubaydah,the first CIA detaineeto undergo torture,andcontinuing on with numerous others,the techniques went on for days or weeks at a time",2
0,"There were physical beatings, mock executions, sleep deprivations for days at a timewhilestanding with hands chained above their heads,and threatsto sexually assault or kill detainees' family members",2
0,"One detainee even died, apparently of hypothermia, afterbeing chained nearly naked to a cement floor",2
1,"Reading the report,one hasto askhowthe US, or any country for that matter could morally justifywhatwas done",0
1,It can't,0
1,The final finding and conclusion was an understatement,0
1,"in that the CIA's torture programme ""damaged the United States' standing in the world""",0
1,And that's somethingthe US isn't goingto get over any time soon,0
1,"Asa longtime global leader in human rights issues, particularly on the subject of torture,the US has lost its moral credibility on the world stage",0
1,The first step inending the torture programmewas accomplished in 2009,0
0,US President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning it shortly aftertaking office,2
1,That's the law of the land in the US right now,0
1,whenObama leaves office in 2016,0
1,there's nothingto stop his successor fromauthorising it again,0
1,"Except, of course, the court of public opinion",0
1,which iswhythe release of this report was so important,0
4,"In a recent Pew Research report, half the US public polled thought torture could be justified sometimes or even often",2
1,The second step happened last night with SSCI's public release of their report summary,0
1,"No doubt, thosewho are still in favour the torture programme, particularly the former Bush Administration and the CIA officials closely involved with it,will aggressively refute the facts laid out in SSCI's report",0
3,Let them,1
1,"Then, it's timeto have a frank and informed discussion on the wholetorture issue,separating the facts from the myths",0
1,The American public and its leaders needto ask themselvesiftorture ishowthey really wantto be defined,0
1,Does the end really justify the means?,0
1,"Afterreading the report,one would haveto wonderhowit could",0
1,"Torture is wrong, plain and simple",0
1,The US needsto reject it outright now,0
1,"whilethe report, in all its shocking and macabre detail, is fresh in the public's mind",0
1, they'll findthemselves going back downthat path again the next time fear and panic take hold,0
1,you thinkbullies are teenagers lurking on schoolyard playgrounds,0
1,think again,0
1,At least one is a grown-up walking the hallowed halls of Harvard University,0
1,His name is Ben Edelman,0
1,He not only teaches there,0
0,he earned several diplomas including a law degree at that storied institution of higher education,2
1,"But Edelman seemsto have adoptedthe word ""higher""as his personal calling card",0
1,he's higher than you and me,0
1,Or at least he seems anxiousto letyou know it,0
0,A hardworking Chinese immigrant family found that out,2
0,the professor ordered a takeout meal of shredded chicken with spicy garlic sauce and three other dishes,2
0,Edelman thoughthe was overcharged by $ 4 bucks ($ 1 dollar more for each dish),2
1,he launched a relentless war on Ran Duan,0
0,"who works with his parents at their restaurant, Sichuan Garden in Brookline",2
3,You can read the sordid details in a story at Boston.com,1
0,the website also published the unbelievable litany of Edelman's intimidating and condescending emails to Duan,2
1,The prof's remarks ooze with arrogance and conceit,0
1,Edelman's exchange with Duan has become a viral sensation,0
1,asit should,0
1,A Harvard professor vowing legal action over the sum of $ 4 dollars,0
0,The professor has now apologized for his treatment of Duan and his family,2
1,"his emails will leaveyou shaking your head in disbeliefthat someone so supposedly ""learned"" could be so seemingly insufferable",0
1,Maybe that'swhata Harvard education gets you these days,0
1,"Arrogance aside, the professor's persistent threats of legal action constitute a shameful campaign of bullying",0
1,He uses his knowledge of the law --at least his tortured interpretation of it-- for a purposethat can only be describedas abusive,0
1,he has done this before to a different restaurant,0
1,Bullies tendto target the weak and vulnerable,0
1,"For Edelmanto use his advantage as a lawyerto berate the Duan familywho have come from nothing as immigrants and are trying their bestto make a living running a restaurantis, in a word, unconscionable",0
5,"During one email exchange,Duan asked the professor,""you seem like a smart man...don't you have better thingsto do?""",2
1,Bullies usually don't,0
1,"For allI know,Edelman is a pretty good professor",0
1,That does not makehim a good person,0
1,Clinical psychiatrists might findhim to be an interesting case study inhowliving in the Harvard bubble can distort even the most agile of minds,0
1,Sometimes intellectuals take themselves too seriously,0
1,"Sequestered from the experiences of the average man,they can lack common sense, kindness and decency",0
1,Edelman seems bereft of them all,0
1,"There is a reasonwhyplaces like Harvard are called""ivory towers""",0
1,"All too often, they envelop an artificial atmosphere",0
1,intellectuals are disconnected from the practical concerns of everyday life,0
1,"So, it should be no surprisewhenguys likeBen Edelman explode like a bomb on some poor immigrant family tryingto make a buck with the sweat of their brow",0
1,"Fortunately, academic elitism is not contagious",0
1,Teaching at Harvardmay be a lofty achievement in the egg-head world,0
1,But professor Edelman seems to lack the one qualitywhich elevates people above all other primates: compassion,0
1,He might gain a measure of humility and understanding bygetting a real job,0
0,Might I suggestwashing dishes in a Chinese restaurant?,2
3,"The next timeI visit the Boston area,I'll skip Harvard Yard",1
3, I planto drop by the Sichuan Gardento try their sauteed prawns with roasted chili and peanut sauce,1
3,And I won't check the bill,1
0,Australians turning on their televisions Monday morningto watch breakfast and cooking showswere instead greeted with news channels beaming minute-to-minute fearmongering of the ongoing siege at a chocolate shop in Sydney,2
0,Whencustomers and employees were taken hostage by a lone gunman,2
0,"a flagwith""There is only one God"" inscription in Arabicwas held in the window",2
1,it was enoughto hold the rest of the country hostage to their fears and TV screens,0
1,whatshould an appropriate response look like?,0
1, considerwhatthis violent thug had designed our reactionto be,0
1,"The site of the siege was likely no afterthought - located in the heart of the Sydney CBD and directly opposite a major television station,the shop had madeit ideal for the mediato report on",0
0,Streets were cordoned off,2
0,public transport diverted,2
0,a strong contingent of police sent to the Opera House,2
1,All made for good visuals of the incident and terror in an otherwise peaceful city,0
0,"Even the most left-leaning and progressive members of parliament, like Greens MP Adam Bandt,who have repeatedly defended the Muslim community from unjust discrimination and generalisation,tweeted to their followers in the first hours of the siegethat it was ""terrifying""",2
1,Was it really?,0
0,"Was it at all terrifying for you personally, Adam?",2
1,it was,0
1,"I'd hateto knowwhatthe hostages experienced, including the twowho were murdered",0
1,"For once, Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a more mature response than his colleagues on the opposite side",0
5,"Such a situation can ""scare people out ofbeing themselves"",he said in his first press briefing, beforeurgingall Australians to go about their business as usual",2
0,Althoughhe told the publicto remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities,2
0,he said so with calm and caution,2
0,"Vitally, he avoidedusing the t-word at this early stage, or any formulationthereof",2
1,No doubt we have since learnt a lot more about this deranged outsider and his motives,0
1,it is clearhe had terrorist intent,0
1,"His website,which was shut down during the final hours of the siege,had a message dated December 14,which describedwhyMuslims ""fight against the oppression and terrorism"" of the US and its allies,including the UK and Australia",0
1,"The rampant speculation before this was unnecessary and unhelpful, however",0
1,"letting the siegesowfear, enough soto publicly describe it as ""terrifying"",was handing a victory to an extremist",0
1,"With the hot Australian summer setting in,many people's minds turn to beer, barbeques, family, and Christmas presents,notthe possibility of ""politically motivated violence"", as Abbott wisely phrased it",0
1,"Intriguingly, Australians fear terrorism more than a foreign invasion, despitemany believingwe'd have no hope offending off the latterand despiteus never directly experiencing the former",0
1,it's no wonderthis all-too-easy escape mechanismwhich avoids rigorous thought or objective analysiswas adopted en masse,0
0,"The most noted incidents in Australia's experience of terrorism have been mostly foreign tragedies, like the Bali bombings in 2002 and 2005, or the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta",2
0,Althoughthe September raids and arrests of suspected domestic terrorists in Sydney and Brisbane set a new landscape and brought the thought of an attack to our own shores,2
1,"they merely raised the thought, not the authentic actuality",0
0,The raids sparked limited local backlash against peaceful Muslims at the time,2
1,this was both unwarranted and unwanted,0
1,Thoughit only goesto further support my thesis,0
1,Australians just aren't used to this sort of thing and thus are unpractised in their response,0
1,it hasn't stopped thousands on social mediato show solidarity with minorities through the #IllRideWithYou campaign,0
0,the Abbott government raised the domestic terrorism threat level to high before the September raids,2
1,many local commentators criticisedwhatthey branded as political theatre (both before and after the arrests),0
1,To consider thisisto suggest an even baser type of political animalthanis presently expected by even the most cynical of observers,0
1,Would any rational actor toy with people's lives for short-term political ends inwhatwas an unimportant political week?,0
1,What enddoes that even achieve?,0
1,"Plainly, none, and it is sensationally conspiratorialistto suggest otherwise",0
1,To protest against such raids and continuelooking at them through a political lenswas just as unwarranted and unwanted as the racial-profiling and racial- hatredwhich events like thesehave sparked,0
2,"Terrorism isn't somethingthat we should let foster, anywhere",2
1,the public reactions to the raids were unjustifiably sceptical in comparison to the response to the Sydney siege,0
1, the authorities' heed for caution may have come too late for some,0
1,Slipshod media reportsthat the flag held in the shop window was an ISIL flag -whenit was not-may have already fuelled the imaginations of too many,0
1,"the outcome of the full investigation,one thing remains clear",0
1,"This was a tragic learning experience for the Australian media, public, and politicians",0
1,"Keep calm and carry on, thoughpay a thought or twotohowwe oughtYou see it everywhere this time of year: ""Peace on Earth, Good Will to All People.""",0
5,"Meanwhile, according to the British newspaper The Independent, only eleven countries on earth are free from violent conflict",2
4,There are more than twenty-five full-on wars happening right now and 169 violent militia and rebel conflicts,2
1,whenwill it happen?,0
1,It's timeto adopt an Alcoholics Anonymous approach to world peace,0
1,"According to scientists, for as longasthere have beenintoxicants, a portion of human beings has struggled with addiction",0
1,"For millennia, various disciplines including medicine, psychiatry and religion attempted, unsuccessfully,to help people suffering from an addiction to booze",0
1,All of the approaches stemmed from the same common approach,0
1,Let's resolve your problemssoyou'll stop drinking,0
1,Alcoholics Anonymous reversed this,0
1,"A.A  has succeededbecauseit was the firstto say,""Stop drinking FIRSTand thenwe'll work on your problems.""",0
1,"Thanks to this subtle shift, countless jobs, marriages, and even lives have been saved",0
1,"Heretofore, humanity's approach to peace has been like outdated approaches to alcoholism",0
1,"Attempts at peace have centered on,""Let's resolve our differencessowe can stopkilling each other.""",0
1,This has only lead to the discovery of more differences and more killing,0
1,"It's timewe followed the example of recovery programs such as A.A  and resolve to, FIRST, stop killing each otherand thenwe can work on our differences",0
1,War is used as a tool of international policybecausepeople accept it,0
1,Allwe haveto dois change our minds--to ceaseto believethat war is an acceptable necessary eviland to beginto believethat no disagreement is worthkilling each other's children,0
1,Countries have been tryingto resolve their differencesso that there will no longer be war,0
1,We needto declare peace first and then spend eternityworking out our differences,0
1,The option of war is simply removed from the table,0
1,"This iswhyI am declaring enduring world peace beginning September 21, 2056",0
2,September 21st is the United Nations World Day of Peace,2
1,so there is already momentum there,0
1,We just needto turn those national celebrations into a countdown to world peace,0
1,"2056 is far enough in the futurethat it gives us time for enough peopleto make the requisite shift in belief suchthat peace will, indeed, reign on planet Earth",0
1,Who am Ito make such a proclamation?,0
0,I'm just a writer and an ordained minister,2
0,"there are crazy preacherswho, every decade or so, declarethe end of the world is coming on this or that date",2
1,So whycan't I saywhenworld peace will begin?,0
1,"Incidentally, this is not a new idea",0
5,"The Kellogg Briand Pact of 1927, sponsored by the United States and signed by 62 countries declaredthat war may not be usedto resolve ""disputes or conflicts of whatever nature orof whatever originthey may be,which may arise.""",2
1,Every major religion shares a common belief in the sanctity of human life and yet war has endured,0
1,enough people believe--just believe,0
1,"that asof September 21, 2056 war will end on planet earth--it must happen!",0
1,"eleven, only eleven out of 196 countries are at peace",0
2,"it still means that right now, in at least eleven countriesthere is peace",2
1,We simply needto build on this over the next forty-two years,0
1,"This year,whenyou say,""Peace on Earth,"" give peace a beginning date",0
1,A spectre is haunting Germany and Europe,0
1,the spectre is called PEGIDA,0
1,"Until recently only a few people had heard of PEGIDA, acronym for ""Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident.""",0
0,"It started as a small protest movement in the eastern city of Dresden against the influx of immigrants, foreign workers and asylum seekers and, above all, against the ""Islamisation"" of Germany",2
1,"Adopting the slogan""We are the people""of the weekly anti-communist demonstrations in 1989which ultimately led to the overthrow of the German Democratic Republic,PEGIDA's appeal seemsto have grown week after week",0
0,"The hundreds of demonstrators of the first few Monday evening ""walks"" in Dresden have swollen to tens of thousands",2
0,"Besides Dresden, there are now similar weekly rallies in other big German cities",2
1,"With its history of anti-Semitism and fascism many findit shockingthat a considerable number of Germans, particularly in the east of the country, are flocking to a xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic movement",0
1,"The surge of the anti-Islamisation movement has led to polarisation of the public opinion, many counter demonstrations and a fierce public debate, involving politicians, church leaders and academics",0
0,Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticised PEGIDA and called on Germansnot to attend their rallies,2
5,"""Donot follow the peoplewho organise these, for their heartsare cold and often full of prejudice, and even hate,""Merkel said in her New Year's Eve speech",2
1,Not everybody agrees,0
0,"Development Minister Gerd Muller of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), warnednot to exclude PEGIDA sympathisers",2
5,"""The overwhelming majority of those demonstrators are not racists at all",2
5,Many of them are low income Germans,2
5,"andthey feelthey are being neglected,whilerefugees are offeredhelp",2
5,"The refugees, but also other migrants, are perceived by these people as competitors",2
5,In spite of our flourishing economy there are millions of poor families in Germany,2
5,"The poor feel marginalised and not represented.""",2
1,"The CSU, Merkel's CDU's sister party and longtime political ally, has been accused ofshowinga bit too muchunderstanding for PEGIDA",0
1,"In fact the CSU's positions on immigration, integration and tougher rules for asylum seekers are quite similar to PEGIDA's",0
1,"It may well bethat the CSU is distancing itself from Merkelbecauseit is worried about right-wing competitors like the anti-establishment and eurosceptic AfD, Alternative fur Deutschland (Germany's Alternative)",0
1,The AfD may succeed inwinning over many of the PEGIDA-sympathisers,0
1,"AfD-chairman Bernd Lucke has gone out of his wayto advocate a dialogue with this ""new civil movement"" and listen carefully to its arguments",0
1,"At the same time Lucke tried carefullynot to alienate the more ""respectable"" right-wing voters and to distance himself from a too xenophobic discourse",0
1,Other AfD leaders are less ambiguous and clearly show support of PEGIDA byparticipating in their marches and inviting PEGIDA organisers to Saxony's regional parliament,0
1,Some German observers don't doubt the existence of an alliance between AfD and PEGIDA,0
5,"Analyst Volker Wagener sees the AfD as the ""parliamentary voice of the street""",2
5,He notesthat the AfD manages to score with a xenophobic discourse especially in the east of Germany,2
1,the AfD succeeds intranslating PEGIDA's objectives politically and electorally,0
1,it may takea role not unsimilar to Marine le Pen's National Front in France and especially Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands,0
1, there is a striking similarity between the anti- Islamisation positions of Geert Wilders and PEGIDA,0
1,"Like Wilders' Freedom Party, PEGIDA does not only condemn jihadists and Islamist terrorists but Islam itself",0
1,"Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and the islamic religion are all lumped together in a vague, scary, threatening mix",0
5,"Both the Freedom Party and PEGIDA claimto defend the ""conservation of the Judeo-Christian heritage""",2
5,Both claimnot to be radical,2
1,PEGIDA and Wilders' party do in fact appeal to right wing radicals and extremists,0
0,"Neo- Nazis and violent""hooligans against Salafists"" openly support PEGIDA",2
1,Both forces represent a significant portion of the population in Germany and the Netherlands,0
1,there would be parliamentary elections in the Netherlands nowWilders' Freedom Party would be the first or second political force in the country (depending onwhich poll to believe),0
4,"In Germany, around 30 percent of the population thinksPEGIDA's concerns are legitimate",2
0,"Some German experts saythe debate shows the need for a redefinition of""who is a German""and recognition of Germany as an immigration country",2
4,"According to a recent study, most Germans see somebody as ""German""whenhe or she speaks German welland has a German passport",2
4,Some 38 percent of those polled saidthat womenwho wore headscarvescould not be German,2
1,"To define a new concept of ""German-ness"" and promote a welcoming culture of tolerance and opennesswill not be an easy task, and should probably not be left to the politicians",0
0,I was born in July 1984,2
0,I was only five months oldwhenthe disaster struck my community,2
0,"I was too youngto remember anything from the night of December 2, 1984",2
0,"throughout the years, I have heard many stories from the peoplewho were there and sawit happen",2
0,My sister would sometimes tell me things about that night,2
0,thoughwe generally avoidedbringing it up,2
0,aswe knewthat it would only hurtus to talk about it,2
0,"After the disaster, some of our relatives,who had heard about it on the radio,came and took us to Lucknow, around 600km from Bhopal",2
0,We stayed with them for a few months,2
0,they startedtreating us badly,2
1,we were a burden to them and their families,0
0,"it was our brother Sunil, another survivor from our family of 10 - aged 13 at the time of the disaster -who decidedto bring us back to Bhopal",2
0,"Subsequently, we were sent to an orphanage in Bhopal, called The SOS Children's Village",2
0,"Sunil refusedto live with us in the orphanage,and got involved with the anti-Carbide campaign",2
0,He createdan organisation called Children Against Carbide,2
0,"Most of the members of this organisation were children from the communitywe were from - Jay Prakash Nagar (JP Nagar), right across the road from the main Bhopal plant",2
0,I was happy with my life at the orphanage in Bhopal,2
0,"I had almost everything: cricket bats, skates, football, good education etc",2
0," at the same time, I did not know anything about our parents",2
0,"In middle school, we would have parent-teacher meetings at school",2
0,my classmates had their parents next to them for the meeting,2
0,I had no one next to me,2
0,It was around that timethat I startedasking my sister about our parents,2
0,It was thenthat my sister first told me about the Bhopal gas disasterandwhathad happened that night,2
0,"Until then, I never fully understoodthat I was growing up in an orphanageand didn't really know the meaning of the word ""orphanage""",2
0,My sister Mamta told methat there were four brothers and four sisters in our family,2
0,Our father was a carpenter,2
0,I was the youngest in the family,2
0,We lost three sisters and two brothers along with our parents that night,2
0,"I then asked her,""Howdidwe survive?""",2
0,"She told methat she wrapped me in a blanket, and ran away along with our brother Sunil",2
0,"Whenthey were running,Sunil hadto go to the bathroom,and fainted",2
0,The streets were so crowded,2
0,aspeople were running and shouting,2
0,"my sister was forced by the crowd, and couldn't wait any longer for my brother Sunilto come back",2
0,He succeeded in 2006,2
0,whenhe hung himself,2
0,"So, now it is just Mamta and I - the only survivors from a family of 10",2
0,Mamta lives in Lucknow with her husband and two children,2
0,I live here in Bhopal on my own,2
0,She would often complain about severe headaches and eye problems,2
0,It has been almost 30 years now,2
1,Bhopalis are still fighting for their basic rights,0
1,"The disaster took so many lives, and is still killing people, as the abandoned factorycontinues poisoning our soil, water, and air",0
0,I startedlearning more about the disaster,2
0,whenI saw people of different ages chanting slogans in the streets of BhopalwhenI was a child,2
0,"In 2004, Greenpeace flew me to Paristo participate in a demonstration outside Dow's shareholders meeting",2
0,I got involved with the campaign in 2004 partly because of my brother's participation in the campaign,2
1,It was betterto diefighting for our rights than succumb to depression overwhathad happened,0
0,"I had a stroke in 2005, and startedtaking an aspirin everyday",2
0,I also had a pulmonary embolism in the US last year,2
0,Now I no longer take an aspirin,2
0,"because nowIhaveto take 7.5mg of warfarin, a bloodthinner",2
0,which is also used as rat poison,2
0,"In 2008, I was one of a number of Bhopal survivors in New Delhiwho fasted for 21 days,only having water",2
0,We were asking then Prime Minister Manmohan Singhto set up an empowered commissionto lookinto the issues related to Bhopal,2
0,We also wanted clean waterto be supplied to the peoplewho were living in the affected communitiesand were forcedto drink contaminated water,2
1,Everyone on this earth should feel this anger and frustration,0
1,It has been 30 yearsandjustice continuesto elude the people of Bhopal,0
1,"We, the people of Bhopal, believethat the whole world has transformed into a Bhopal in a way",0
1,you look around,0
1,"you see multinational corporationsbeing allowedto do business without accountability,poisoning the world and placing profits over people",0
1,justice comes to Bhopal,0
1,then it would be justice for the whole world,0
1,"It would set a precedent and ensurethat in the future, corporations committing such crimes are brought to justice",0
0,Poland's recent local elections went according to the usual script: The ruling coalition of the Civic PlatformandPolish People's Party retained their control over major cities,2
1,But there was one political surprise in the final results,0
1,"The urban movement,which ran for the first time in elections as a nationwide coalition of city activists,won the mayor's seat in Gorzow Wielkopolski, in western Poland, and a number of city council seats in big cities like Warsaw, Poznan and Torun",0
1,"Althougha newcomer to the electoral race,the urban movement dictated the direction of most election campaigns",0
1,Their demands ended up in the electoral programmes of mainstream political parties,0
1,which scrambledto attract grassroot activists on their liststo capture the youth leftist vote,0
1,So whatis this new political force and canit permanently transform Polish local and state politics?,0
0,"In late 2007, a group of residents of the Rataje district in Poznan, in western Poland, organisedto defend their rightto have a say in the planning of their neighbourhood",2
0,"The mayor of Poznan and the city council, had proposedto transform the derelict post-industrial zone of the neighbourhood into a new residential and commercial area",2
0,"Local residents, on the other hand, insisted onbuilding a park and a recreational area",2
0,"They mobilisedthe community, organised protests, wrote petitions and publicised the issue in the media",2
1,The negative publicity madethe situation uncomfortable enough for local officialsto concede to public pressure and withdraw their commercial development proposal,0
1,This was the first signthat a new social force was emerging with the potentialto affect urban policies in Poland through civic engagement,0
1,Grassroot activities beganto surface in other Polish cities around that time,0
0,Activists from Sopot in northern Poland startedcalling for participatory budgeting following the model of the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre,2
0,"In Lodz, in central Poland, an informal group of active citizens organised themselves around the issue of cleanliness of public spaces",2
0,"Gradually, these groups merged into a movement calling for citizen participation in the transformation of the post-industrial area of the city, just like in Poznan",2
0,Lodz usedto be an important industrial centre up until 1989,2
0,its textile industry collapsed,2
0,many industrial buildings lay abandoned and derelict,2
0,"In Warsaw, urban activists organised demonstrations for the preservation of green areas in the centre of the Polish capital; against hikes in public transport fees,;and against privatisation of municipal buildings",2
0,"In the last few years,groups like Right to the City, Inhabitants' Forum,andthe Housing Movement have emerged in almost every Polish town bringing together individuals of various ages, social, and cultural backgrounds",2
1,"These groups were involved in a variety of campaignsto reassert residents' rights to their neighbourhoods and towns: from writing petitions, to organising protests, pickets and demonstrations, tooccupying vacant buildings, setting up squats and blocking evictions",0
1,Their political appetite grew with time,0
0,"In 2010, Poznan activists formed:""We, the Inhabitants of Poznan,"" social electoral committee to contest local elections",2
4,They received almost 10 percent of the votes,2
1,"with an electoral law favouring big political parties, they failedto get a seat on the council",0
0,"This electoral experience facilitated the launching, in 2011, ofan informal coalition - the Urban Movements Congress - comprising urban activist groups from all over Poland",2
1,The congress was tasked withformulating a programmeto provide a common foundationaround which urban activists would build their campaigns in local communities,0
0,"The programme was focused on three main pillars:policies to stem and reverse the growth of socioeconomic inequalities and exclusion; sustainable environment-conscious urban development in the interest of all residents; and promotion of direct democracy practices such as social consultations, participatory budgeting and referendums",2
1,"After the founding of the congress, the urban movements grew in strength and impact",0
0,"On the national level, the congress managedto pressure the Ministry of Regional Developmentto include some of its policies in its 2012 National Urban Policy (NUP) programme",2
1,"On the local level, urban activists managedto reap a number of victories",0
0,"In 2011, after much ""harassment"" from activists, the mayor of Sopot agreedto implement participatory budgeting in the city",2
0,Residents now can decide onhowto spend 5 million zlotys (about $1.6m) or one percent of the municipal budget,2
1,Other mayors soon followed suit,0
0,"In Lodz, residents decide onhowto spend 40 million zlotys ($13m)",2
0,The mayor of Lodz also invited local activiststo advise the city council's Revitalisation Bureau on specific policies for the socioeconomic development of the city,2
1,The reasonwhyLodz became more accepting of the urban movement's demandswasbecauseits previous mayor was removed in a popular referendum in January 2010,0
0,"The mayors of Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Elblag, Bytom and Ostroda were also removed in the same manner forintroducing policies regarding privatisation and commercial development",2
1,which went against the will of their electorates,0
1,The same fate threatened the mayor of Warsaw,0

1,"Aftersurviving in her post,she quickly implemented some of the urban movement's demands",0
1,But the most spectacular achievement of the Polish urban movement in recent months was putting Krakow's candidacyto host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games to a referendum,0
0,"Afterit was announced in November 2013that local authorities had decidedto put forward Krakow's candidacy for the Olympics,activists launcheda campaign called Krakow Against Games",2
1,which aimedto inform people of the negative consequences ofhosting big sporting event,0
0,"City authorities caved in under popular pressure and put the decision to a referendum, with the conditionthat it has at least a 30 percent turnout",2
1,Knowingthat the 2010 EU elections had only a 26 percent turnout,0
0,they combined the referendum with the 2014 EU elections,2
4,"To the displeasure of local authorities,some 36 percent of Krakow's citizens voted",2
4,70 percent of those said no to the games,2
1,Victory of the Krakow Against Games campaign showedthat referendums can be an important tool inbringing local policies in line with residents' will,0
1,that urban activists have considerable social support,0
1,The Krakow victory gave impetus to the formation by of nationwide coalition of 12 sociopolitical entities affiliated with the Urban Movements Congressto contest the 2014 local elections,0
1,The results of the election demonstratedthat the movement can translate its grassroot support into electoral victories,0
1,"With the 2015 parliamentary and presidential elections approaching, the coalition is hopefulthat it will have an even larger political impact in the coming year",0
1,The urban movement has a long wayto goin orderto occupy a permanent place on Poland's political map,0
1,"its public presence, successful campaigns and increasing social support showthat there is a definite shift in Polish people's sociopolitical attitudes",0
1,There is clearly growing support for sustainable and environment-conscious developmentwhich aimsto level out inequalities and exclusion and usher in effective practices of direct democracy,0
1,I haveto confess,0
0,I was suckered by the trailer for American Sniper,2
1,It's a masterpiece of short-form tension - a confluence of sound and image so viscerally evocativeit feels almost domineering,0
1,You cannot resist,0
1,You will be stressed out,0
1,You will feel,0
1,"""Clint Eastwood's American Sniper trailer will ruin your pants.""",0
1,"however effectiveit is as a piece of cinema,evena cursory look into the film's backstory - and particularly the public reaction to its release -raises disturbing questionsabout which storieswe chooseto codify into truth,andwhose, and why, and the messy social costs of transmogrifying real life into entertainment",0
0,"Chris Kyle, a US navy Seal from Texas, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and claimedto have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career",2

0,thoughthat was never substantiated,2
0,He was murdered in 2013 at a Texas gun range by a 25-year-old veteran reportedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,2
1,"we diverge politically,I have enough faith in Eastwood's artistry and intellectto trustthat he is not a black-and-white ideologue",0
1,"- or, at least,that he knowsthat the limitations of such a worldview would make for an extremely dull movie",0
1,"But the same can't be said for Eastwood's subject, or,asresponse to the film has demonstrated,many of his fans",0
5,"AsLaura Miller wrote in Salon:""In Kyle's version of the Iraq war, the parties consisted of Americans,who are good by virtue ofbeing American,and fanatic Muslimswhose 'savage, despicable evil' ledthem to wantto kill Americans simplybecausethey are Christians.""",2
5,"Adds Scott Foundas at Variety:""Chris Kyle saw the world in clearly demarcated terms of good and evil,andAmerican Sniper suggeststhat such dichromatism may have been key to both his success and survival;on the battlefield, doubt is akin to death.""",2
5,"Eastwood, on the other hand, Foundas says, ""sees only shades of gray""",2
1,"American Sniper is a morally ambiguous, emotionally complex film",0
1,there are a lot of Chris Kyles in the world,0
1,"the chasm between Eastwood's intent and his audience's reception touches on the old Chappelle's Show conundrum: a lot of white people laughed at Dave Chappelle's rapier racial satire for the wrong reasons, in waysthat may have actually exacerbated stereotypes about black people in the minds of intellectual underachievers",0
1,Is that Chappelle's fault?,0
1,Should he care?,0
1,"Likewise, much of the US right wing appearsto have seized upon American Sniper withsimilarly shallow comprehension - treating it with the same unconsidered, rah-rah reverencethat they would the national anthem or the flagitself",0
1,"Only a few weeks into its release, the film has been flattened into a symbolto serve the interests of an ideologythat, arguably, runs counter to the ethos of the film itself",0
1,"How much,ifat all,should Eastwood concern himself with fanswho misunderstandand misuse his work?",0
1,"Ifhe, intentionally or not, makes a hero out of Kyle-who, bare minimum,was a racistwho took pleasure indehumanising and killing brown people- ishe responsible forvalidating racism, murder, and dehumanisation?",0
1,Is he a propagandistifpeople use his work as propaganda?,0
0,That question came to the fore last week on Twitterwhenseveral liberal journalists drew attention to Kyle's less Oscar-worthy statements,2

1,They call for the rape or death of anyone ungrateful enoughto criticise American hero Chris Kyle,0
1,"BecauseChris Kyle is good,and brown people are bad,andAmerica is in danger,andChris Kyle saved us",0
1,The attitude echoeswhatMiller articulated about Kyle in her Salon piece,0
5,"""his steadfast imperviousness to any nuance, subtlety or ambiguity, and his lack of imagination and curiosity, seem particularly notable""",2
1,"There is no room for the ideathat Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy;or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; or a complex guy in a bad warwho convinced himselfhe lovedkillingto cope with an impossible situation;or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive systemthat, yes,also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial-killer people to do oppressive things overwhich they have no control",0

0,The Sydney siege saw a slew of Muslim organisations issue statementscondemning Islamic extremism,2
1,Such chastisement had meant something in the wake of 9/11 and the Bali bombings,0
1,"Today, this has degraded into an automated knee-jerk response",0
1,It has been said so many timesthat its gravitas is greatly diminished,0
1,"More subtly,this expectation for Muslimsto keepspeaking outis nothing short of Islamophobic",0
1,"It assumesthat Islam is, at its core, evil",0
1,It also upholds the viewthat Muslims can be essentialised as a monolithic whole,0
1,The chastisement thus becomes the yardstick fromwhich the wider world isto differentiate between a good Muslim and a bad Muslim,0
1,"Surely today, fourteen years after 9/11, we have wisened up to the factthat such atrocious acts are committed out of political, even criminal, intent more than theology",0
1,"Surely, it is not a stretchto thinkthat no one individual can represent an entire faith community",0
1,".Surely, it is time,asMax Fisher of Vox argues,to stopaskingMuslims to condemn terrorism",0
1,"In the same manner, this good Muslim, bad Muslim binary undergirds the #illridewithyou campaign",0
1,"Yes, the hashtag was borne out of goodwill",0
0,an Asian Australian woman started it,2
0,asthe Twitter universe reacted to the story of a woman pledgingto walk in solidarity with another womanwho took her hijab off following news of the Sydney siege,2
1,"We will protect the good Muslims, so gestures the campaign",0
1,"Unfortunately, it also reproduces an age-old tropethat has been highlighted by scholars of postcolonial studies",0
1,"Aswestern colonisers encounter non-European natives,they beganto think of their ""other"" in one of two antithetical ways - either as a barbaric savage or a noble savage",0
1,"To the colonisers, the hostile savage is inherently dangerous in a sub-human way and always an enemy to the civilised individual",0
1,"Meanwhile, the noble savage is romanticised as innately benign",0
1,"Untouched by modernisation,the noble savage should be admired and protected",0
1,"Transposed to modern times,the hostile savage translates as the bad Muslim and the noble savage - the good Muslim",0
1," barbaric or noble, a savage is still a savage",0
1,The hashtag #illridewithyou is just as patronising,0
1,Another factorthat cast doubt to #illridewithyourelates to this question:Was the perpetrator Man Haron Monis the quintessential Islamic extremist?,0
1,the slate of profile piecesthat are now just flooding our newsfeedcan be taken as a gauge,0
1,the jury is still out on this,0
1,"At first glance, one may indeed be temptedto fit him into the mould ofwhatsome security experts have called""bedroom jihadists"", a fashionable termto describe self-radicalised individualswho have been recruited online to planand execute terror attacksthat would advance the cause of clandestine Islamist organisations",0
1,Yet Monis was a man of many masks,0
1,Closer inspection would revealthat he does not nestle comfortably into this category,0
0,His demands may have included an ISIL flag,2
1,he made no strategic overturesthat would advance the cause of any oppressed Muslim groups,0
1,"At this juncture, it is doubtfulifhe had even made contact with ISIL",0
1,Letus also not forgetthat Monis was not a nobodywho was secretly being turned to the ways of ISIL or any other Islamist agenda,0
1, he was a well-known criminal,0
0,"Not onlyhad Monis been charged withbeing an accessory to the brutal murder of his wife last year,he had also been slapped with 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault",2
0, information has surfacedthat he had been charged with fraud in Iran,2
0,which requested his extradition from Australia some 14 years ago,2
5,"a friend rightly pointed out on social media,Monis' criminal records qualify him as a ""sexual predator and misogynist""",2
1, this more dominant aspect of his identity has not stopped the rest of the world fromlinking the Sydney siege to the threat of Islamic fundamentalism,0
0,"During the Sydney siege, a shooting spree incidence unfolded in Montgomery County, Pennsylvaniathat left6 dead",2
0,"International media agencies described the perpetrator, the now-deceased Bradley William Stone, simply as ""a suspect"", ""a gunman on the loose"" and even ""a Montgomery man""",2
2,No hashtag campaign was necessaryto assure white peoplethat the rest of the world will ride with themto keepthem safe,2
1,The same can be observed of the reaction to the mass killings committed by the Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011,0
0,"Breivik had claimedhimself a baptised Christian in his 1,500-page manifesto",2
1,the world did not expectChristians to condemn terrorism in the same wayMuslims had,0
1,This discrepancy is telling of the power imbalance of our contemporary world,0
1,"To white Australia, #illridewithyou may be its golden moment",0
1,"To the rest of the coloured world, nothing has changed",0
1,It has been a grim start for 2015as far asEuropean tolerance is concerned,0
0,Mosques have been attacked in Sweden,2
0,"Demonstrations continue in Germany against the ""Islamisation of the west""",2
1,And antisemitism is on the rise,0
1,We knewsomething nasty had been unleashed,0
1,whenthe European elections last year produced a surge of populist xenophobic parties,0
2,"Many explanations have been given: the economic crisis, unemployment, the disenfranchisement of the middle classes, anxieties fed by globalisation",2
1,Pointing fingers at strangers or supposed intruders has become almost an automatic reflex,0
1,Anti-immigration parties are having a field day,0
1,"All our problems come from the outside, from some kind of invasion",0
1,that'showthe narrative goes,0
0,In France the novelist Michel Houellebecq is making headlines with a new book imagining the election in 2022 of a Muslim president,2
1,"There are,it is true, signs of a democratic revival against racism",0
0,"In solidarity with Muslims, some citizens have been demonstrating in European cities",2
1,"It is perhaps onlywhenthe worst happens- arson attacks on mosques, or neo-Nazi groups in the streets -that people startmobilising for common decency",0
1,But the trend is worrisome indeed,0
1,"Europeans seemto be grappling with this one question:howdo I live alongside people of a different cultural background, the Other?",0
1,"In times like this, literature and history can helpus seethings more clearly",0
0,I turned to the Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski,2
0,"who spent most of his lifetravelling across the developing world and reflecting onhowEuropeans relate to that huge part of the global populationthat is non- European, and much poorerthan Europeans",2
5,"In his book The Other, Kapuscinski -who had flaws as a journalist, but certainly didn't lack curiosity for different cultures- points outhow difficultit is for inhabitants of the old continentto acceptthat ""the map of the world has changed"" since decolonisation in the 1960s",2
1,"AfterEuropeans still have trouble dealing with the factthat they have becomeless central, less overpowering",0
1,And yet it is a paradox,0
1,"becauseEurope produced arguably the first world citizen open todiscovering and appreciating foreign cultures:the Greek historian Herodotus, 2,500 years ago",0
3,I can hear the cringing,1
1,how delusional and idealisticit isto bring Herodotus into a 21st-century debate on immigration,0
1,roots matter,0
1, Europeans must look at themselves more closely,0
1,"Things were never stable,norpopulations fixed in stone",0
2,Europe is after all the appendix of a great and contrasted landmass,2
1,it was always meantto be a crossroads,0
1,We may be baffled by changes,0
1,there were timeswhenwe lived with much more diversity in our midst,0
1,Tony Judt is greatto read on this,0
5,"In his book Postwar, he recallshow""the European continent was once a complex tapestry of languages, religions, communities, and nationsthat overlapped",2
5,"Many of its cities - including some of the smallest, at the intersection of old and new imperial borders, such as Trieste, Sarajevo, Salonica, Czernowitz, Odessa, Vilnius - were truly multicultural, with Catholics, Orthodox, Muslims, Jews and others mingling.""",2
5,"Judt goes on:""Between 1914 and 1945, however, this Europe was reduced to ashes.""",2
1,"As a result of war, occupation, border changes, expulsions and genocide, most people ended up living among people like them, in different states",0
5,"During the cold war, the two halves of Europe lived in ""hermetic national enclaves"" - a world of homogeneity,notes Judt",2
0,"In the 1960s immigrants arrived in western Europeto providea workforce, most from former colonies",2
5,"Judt callsthis a ""new presence of 'others' living in Europe"",including the millions of Muslims in today's EU",2
5,"He saysthis presence ""has outlined not only Europe's discomfortasit is faced with a renewed and growing diversity,but alsothe ease with which the 'other' dead of Europe's past had crept out of people's minds""",2
3,So there it is,1
1,"today's intolerance has its roots not just in economic frustration, but in amnesia",0
5,"Since 1989 many of Europe's centres have become""cosmopolitan global cities,whetherthey like it or not"",writes Judt",2
3,"Note the""whetherthey like it or not""",1
1,"This book was published 10 years ago, as if in anticipation ofwhatwe see today",0
1,The historian's message isthat Europe's future is multicultural,0
1,Its core values are aboutbeing open to the Other,0
1,The only time Europeans experiencedrelative demographic homogeneity - that era of supposed tranquillity - was in the wake of Hitler's and Stalin's devastations,0
1,Such thoughts might not be enoughto calm the anti-Muslim crowds,0
1,they could help,0
1,Hollywood loves Barack Obama,0
1,"it has expressed this in every wayit knows how, from celebrity endorsements and campaign appearances to huge donations",0
4,"In the 2012 presidential race, show biz folks gave Obama more than six million dollars, five times as much as Romney got",2
0,It has even been announcedthat a biopic of Obama's first date with Michelle--dinner and a Spike Lee movie--is on the way,2
1,Withoutspoiling the plotI can revealthat it has a happy ending,0
1,So Hollywood loves Obama,0
1,"not surprisingly, Obama loves it right back",0
1, he is an admirer of its role in the world,0
5,"""Believeit or not,entertainment is part of our American diplomacy,""Obama told an A-list gathering of movie stars and film executives at DreamWorks, in November 2013",2
5,"""It is part ofwhatmakes us exceptional, part ofwhatmakes us such a world power",2
5,"Hundreds of millions of people may never set foot in the United States, but thanks to you,they've experienced a small part ofwhatmakes our country special",2
5,They've learned something about our values,2
5,"We have shaped a world culture through you...in a waythat has made the world better.""",2
2,This iswhatis known as a matter of opinion,2
1,A dissenting view is held by hundreds of millions of Muslimswho considerthe incursions of the American cinema to be a dangerous and despicable form of Zionist-Crusader cultural imperialism,0
1,Obama's speech to Hollywood will not disabuse them of this belief,0
5,""".[Foreigners] might not know the Gettysburg Address,""Obama said",2
5,"""butifthey're watching some old movie, maybe ""GuessWho's Coming to Dinner,""or ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" or ""Will and Grace"" and ""Modern Family,""they'vehad a front-row seat to our march towards progress,even iftheir own nations haven't made that progress yet",2
5,"And young people in countriesall around the world suddenly make a connection and have an affinity to peoplewho lookdon't like themandmaybeoriginally they might have been fearful of,andnow suddenly they say,oh,this person is like me --which is one of the powers of art",2

1,My point is notthat Hollywood is wrongto make movies and television showsthat reflect American social valuesand suit the American audience,0

1,"I do hope, though,that the president and his advisers understand this:""Will and Grace,"" ""Mary Tyler Moore"" and even the new Obama biopic may win Oscars and Emmys, but in a struggle for hearts and minds in a regionwherecutting-edge refers to swords,not cinema, Hollywood is not a strategic American asset",0
1,Saturday's failed hostage rescue mission in Yemen was indeed tragic,0

0,Late last week AQAP released a videostatinghe would be killed in 72 hoursunlessunspecified demands were met,2
1,"Those demands have not been made public, but likely involved payment of a ransom or release of AQAP captives, somethingthe US is prohibited by law fromdoing",0

1, terrorist messages have traumatised societies and increased militant recruitment around the world,0
1,These issues must be discussed in depth and collectively around the world,0
1,There is a need forcoordinating a credible counter narrative both at the local and the global levelto confront the banality and cruelty of terrorist messages,0

4,"His recovery, over the period comparable to the Obama expansion, registered 4.8 percent annual GDP growth and created 14.3 million jobs--a 16 percent increase from a recession low of 89 million",2
1,The difference was governing philosophy,0
1,"Obama put billions into cumbersome, economically questionable government programs like solar energy, expanded federal entitlements, imposed higher taxes on small entrepreneurs, and burdened businesses and banks with costly and ineffective regulations",0

2,Just asa magician draws your attention towhathe wantsyou to seeyou will not observehowhis trick is performed,2
1,last week presented a textbook example of public disputes masking hidden deceptions,0
3,Here iswhathappened,1
1,Last week was dominated by two huge news stories,0
1,One was the revelation by the Senate Intelligence Committee of torture committed by CIA agents and contractors on 119 detainees in the post-9/11 era -- 26 ofwhom were tortured for months by mistake,0
1,In that revelation of anguish and error were the conclusions by CIA agents themselvesthat their torture had not produced helpful information,0
1,President Obama acknowledgedthat the CIA had tortured,0
1,he directed the Department of Justicenot to prosecute thosewho tortured and thosewho authorized it,0
1,The other substantial news story was the compromise achieved by Congress and the White Houseto fund the government through the end of September 2015,0
1,"That legislation,which is 2,000 pages in length,was not read by anyonewho voted for it",0
4,It spends a few hundred billion dollars morethanthe government will collect in tax revenue,2
1,The compromise was achieved through bribery,0
1,members of Congress bought and sold votes byadding goodies (in the form of local expenditures of money borrowed by the federal government) to the billthat were never debated or independently voted uponand were added solelyto achieve the votes needed for passage,0
1,This ishowthe federal government operates today,0
1,Both parties participate in it,0
1,They have turned the public treasury into a public trough,0
1,Hidden in the lawthat authorized the governmentto spend morethanit will collectwas a part aboutfunding for the 16 federal civilian intelligence agencies,0
1,"hidden in thatwas a clause, inserted by the same Senate Intelligence Committeethat revealedthe CIA torture,authorizingthe National Security Agency to gather and retain nonpublic data for five years and to share it with law enforcement and with foreign governments",0
1,"""Nonpublic data"" is the government's language referring to the content of the emails, text messages, telephone calls, bank statements, utility bills and credit card bills of nearly every innocent person in America -- including members of Congress, federal judges, public officials and law enforcement officials",0
1,"I say ""innocent""becausethe language of this legislation --which purportsto make lawful the NSA spyingwe now all know about-- makes clearthat thosewho spy upon usneedn't have any articulable suspicion or probable cause for spying",0
1,The need for articulable suspicion and probable cause has its origins in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution,0
1,which was writtento prohibitwhatCongress just authorized,0
1,"That amendment was a reaction to the brutish British practice ofrummaging through the homes of American colonists, looking for anythingthat might be illegal",0
1,It is also a codification of our natural right to privacy,0
1,"It requiresthat ifthe government wants nonpublic data from our persons, houses, papers or effects,it must first present evidence of probable cause to a judge and then ask the judge for a search warrant",0
1,Probable cause is a level of evidencethat is sufficientto induce a judge intoconcludingthat it is more likely than notthat the placeto be examinedcontains evidence of crimes,0
2,"In orderto seek probable cause,the government must first have an articulable suspicion about the person or placeit has targeted",2
1,"Were this not in the law,then nothing would stop the government from fishing expeditions in pursuit of anyoneit wantsto pursue",0
1,And fishing expeditions turn the presumption of liberty on its head,0
1,The presumption of liberty is based on the beliefthat our rights are natural to us,0
1,that we may exercise them without a permission slip from the government and without its surveillance,0
1,"Until last week, that is",0
1,"Last week, Congress, byauthorizing the massive NSA spyingto continueand byauthorizingthe spies to sharewhatthey have seized with law enforcement,basically permittedthe fishing expeditionsthat the Fourth Amendment was writtento prevent",0
1,"Howcan the president and Congress defy the Constitution,you might ask?",0
2,Hasn't every member of the government taken an oathto uphold the Constitution?,2
2,Doesn't the Constitution create the presidency and the Congress?,2
1,Howcan politicians purportto change it?,0
1,"The answers to these questions are obvious,asis the belief of most of those in governmentthat they can write any law and regulate any behavior and ignore the Constitutionthey have swornto upholdwheneverthey want",0
1,so longasthey can get away with it,0
0,An Army chaplain was punished fordiscussing matters of faith and quoting from the Bible during a suicide prevention training session with the 5th Ranger Training Battalion -- leading to outrage from religious liberty groups and a Georgia congressman,2

0," attorneys for the chaplain, along with religious advocacy groups, sayhis comments are covered by the ""right of conscience clause""that was passed in last year's National Defense Authorization Act, section 533",2
0,Chaplain Lawhorn was orderedto appear in the colonel's office on Thanksgiving Daywherehe was personally handed the Letter of Concern,2
1,Based on Col  Fivecoat's version of events -- you would've thoughtChaplain Lawhorn had turned the suicide prevention workshop into a Billy Graham Crusade,0
1, that's notwhathappened,0
5,"Ron Crews, the endorsing agent for military chaplains for Grace Churches International, explained,the chaplain discussed his own struggles with depression and the methods and techniqueshe personally usedto combat depression",2
5,He saidthe chaplain did provide a handout with religious resources,2
1,but he also provided a handout with non-religious resources,0
5,"""Thechaplain did nothing wrong,""said Crews",2

0,Lawhorn is one of the few Army chaplainsto wear the Ranger Tab,2

5,"That'swhatchaplains do.They bare their souls for their soldiersin orderto help them with crisesthey may be going through.""",2
0, someone in the training session complained to the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers,2
0,That complaint led to a story on the Huffington Post,2
0,"Michael Berry, an attorney with Liberty Institute, a law firmthat handles religious liberty cases,is representing the chaplain",2
5,"He said the personwho filedthe complained ""exploited"" the chaplain's ""vulnerability.""",2
5,"""Ittook a great amount of courage for Chaplain Lawhornto discuss his own personal battle with depression,""Berry said",2
5,"""At no time didhe considerhimself to be in a 'preacher' role.""",2
5,Berry called on the Armyto rescind the Letter of Concern--calling it a violation of the chaplain's constitutional rights,2
5,"""Notonly is it lawful for a chaplainto talk about matters of faith and spirituality and religion in a suicide prevention training class-but the Army policy encourages discussion of matters of faith and spiritual wellness,""Berry told me",2
5,"""The factthat one person in the class was offendedchanges nothing.""",2
0,"Congressman Doug Collins, a Republican lawmaker from Georgia,whose districtincludes the areawherethe training session took place,fired off a letter to Col  Fivecoat expressing his concerns in the matter",2

0,He cited the Army's Equal Opportunity policy andhowit was set upto protect the personal beliefs of military personnel,2
5,"""IfearChaplain Lawhorn's freedom of expression was improperly singled out,""he wrote",2
0,Liberty Institute tells me the Armywill allowme to speak with the chaplain -- but not right now,2
0,And Col  Fivecoat sent me an email telling methat he would not be ableto comment at this point,2
1,IfI'm reading between the lines -- that Letter of Concerncomes pretty close toaccusing the chaplain of proselytizing,0
1,Crews agrees with my assessment,0
5,"""Thebottom line is --that isexactly whatthey are tryingto accuse him of--whennothing could be further from the truth,""Crews told me",2
5,"""The military leadership needsto commend Chaplain Lawhorn, not condemn him.""",2
5,Berry saidAmericans should be shocked and outraged over Chaplain Lawhorn's punishment,2
5,"""Hisjob isto save lives-- andhe's being punished fortryingto do his job,""Berry said",2
5,"""He'sdoing everythinghe canto save them- and yetnow they're tryingto say - the wayyou're doingit offends me.""",2

1,Wherecan they run around unsupervised?,0
0,"On most of the housing estates I visit,the answer is hardly anywhere",2

5,"AsJay Griffiths argues in her heartrending book Kith,children fill the ""unoccupied territories"", the spaces not controlled by tidy-minded adults, ""the commons of mud, moss, roots and grass""",2

1,But only by comparison,0
1,"Next to the primary school, with plenty of three- and four-bedroom houses, it is designedto appeal to young families",0
0,"But in the middle of the development,wherea village green might have been,there's a strange grassy sump, surrounded by a low fence",2
0,"It's an empty balancing pond,to catch water during exceptional floods",2
1,"Remove the fence, plant it with trees, throw in some rocks and logs,andyou'd have a rough and mossy playground",0
1,But no such thing was in the plans,0
1,Other shared spaces on the estate have the charming ambience of a prison yard,0
0,There were a few children outdoors,2

2,Children don't buy houses,2
1,sowho cares?,0
1,"Throughout the country, they become prisoners of bad design, and so do adults",0
1,"Without safe and engaging placesin which they can come together,no tribe forms",0
1,So parents must play the gamesthat children would otherwise play among themselves,0

1,The exclusion of children arises from the same pathologythat denies us decent housing,0
1,"In the name of market freedom, the volume housebuilders, sitting on their land banks, are freeto preside over speculative chaos",0

1,"A national housing land corporation would assemble the sites and supply the infrastructure, then sell plots to community groups, housing associations and peoplewho wantto build their own",0
1,It goes far beyond England's feeble community right-to-build measures,0

1,"Whatifpeople were entitledto buy an option for a plot on a new estate,which they would then help to plan?",0

3,But vote on it,1
1,Becausethe Obama administration has already gone down a dangerous path,0
1,the executive branch can unilaterally carry out virtually any war,0
1,it wants without any official input from Congress,0
1,"Given the GOP's newfound hatred of executive power,which the party seemto have conveniently forgotten was pioneered during every Republican administration since Nixon",0
1,you'd thinkWashington's new majority might wantto take this tiny step ofdebating and voting on the Isis war,0
1,asis their own constitutional duty,0
1,Republicans would do wellto use the president's own words against him,0
0,As Barack Obama himself told the Boston Globe back in 2007,2
5,The President does not have power under the Constitutionto unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situationthat does not involvestopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation,2
1,"virtually the entire US intelligence community agreesthat Isis, no matterhowawful and heinous the group may be,does not imminently threaten the mainland United States",0
1,maybe Congress can start off the new year bydoing its job and actually voting on something required of them months ago,0

0,Soviet Russia marked the bicentenary of the Treaty of Georgievsk in 1983,2
0,it was met with mass protests from anti-Soviet Georgians,2
1,The Treaty of Georgievsk might have been the first dodgy treatyRussia signed in the region,0
1,it certainly has not been the last,0
1,Soon Russia is expectedto sign a treaty with Georgia's breakaway province South Ossetia,0
0,"Last November, Russia and Abkhazia - another breakaway province in Georgia - signed a treaty on ""alliance and strategic partnership""",2
0,"This treaty established a coordinated foreign policy, the creation of a ""common security and defense space"" between Russia and Abkhazia, and the implementation of a streamlined process for Abkhaziansto receive Russian citizenship",2
1,The pending treaty with South Ossetia is expectedto bring the relationship between South Ossetia and Russia even closer,0
1,Abkhaz officials have shown little interest ingetting annexed by Russia,0
1,many in South Ossetia would be happy with this outcome,0
5,"The defacto leader of South Ossetia Leonid Tibilov saidthe treaty could see the tiny breakaway province""becoming a subject of the Russian Federation""",2

0,they are the only ethnic group foundliving in large numbers on both sides of the mountains,2
1, South Ossetia does not have close links to Russia's North Ossetia,0
1,asone might expect,0
0,The only road linking the two Ossetias runs through the Roki tunnel,2
0,which was only completed in 1984,2
1," Tskhinvali, the administrative capital of South Ossetia, is closer to Tbilisithanit is to North Ossetia's capital city Vladikavkaz",0

0,"Russia is one of only four countriesthat recognise South Ossetia's independence (the othersbeing Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Nauru)",2
0,"By contrast, many European countries and the United States recognise the Russian presence in South Ossetia as an illegal occupation",2
1,Russia needsto think carefully beforeannexing South Ossetia,0
1,Moscow has experienced with Crimea,0
1,"annexation comes at a cost, both economically and geo-politically",0
1,Economic sanctions are startingto bite,0
1,the ruble is down,0
1,the low price of oil is severely impacting the Russian economy,0
0,"Then there are all the other costs associated with annexation:paying for pensions, local services, healthcare, education, and infrastructure",2
1,this is a heavy burden for the stagnate Russian economy,0
5,"The Georgian Foreign Ministry criticised Russia's move as a step toward ""annexation of Georgia's occupied territories""",2
1,"In reality, there is littleGeorgia can do about it",0
1,Raising international awareness and encouragingthe US and Europe to link economic sanctions connected to Russia's annexation of Crimea to any possible annexation of South Ossetiais the first thingthe Georgian government should do,0
1,"The history of the Caucasus has shownthat allegiances have, and can,change over time",0
1,"Through a long term process of confidence building measures, the Georgian government needsto show those in South Ossetiathat their future is brighter with Tbilisi and in the transatlantic communitythanit is with Russia",0
1," Georgia must stick with its ""non-use of force"" pledge regarding the occupied territories",0
1,There is no military solution to either South Ossetia or Abkhazia,0
1,the region can hardly afford another war,0
1,It is ironicthat sincethe early 1990s thousands of South Ossetians have diedfighting for their independence from Georgia,0
1,they are likelyto hand over their sovereignty to Russia,0
1,Russia's treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be seen forwhatthey really are: the first step in a process of Russian annexation of both breakaway regions ,0

5,Schussel concurred,2
1,Fair point,0
1,"But in international relations, a state's ""volition"" is so often shaped and determined by perceived threats",0
1,It's called diplomacy,0
1,it requiresreconciling the pursuit of national interests with regional and global peace,0

1,It's time Ukraine does the same,0
1,The world is inching towards a new Cold War and at the heart ofit is Ukraine,0
1,Whenandwhatwill be the last strawis hardto tell,0
1,But then it will be too lateto reverse things from a point of no return,0
1,Russia today faces serious geopolitical and economic challenges,0
1,"It is in direct confrontation with the West on a vision about the world order, on Ukraine, on Syria and on a great many other large and not-so-large issues",0
1,"Economically, Russia is beginningto feel the aggregate impact of the West's economic sanctions",0
0,"falling oil prices, the devaluation of the ruble, capital outflow and a decline in direct foreign investment",2
1,to thinkthat these pressures will force the Kremlin into even partial submissionand to change its posture on global issues and weaken its grip on its immediate neighbourhoodwould beto misjudge President Vladimir Putin,0
1,It could have the exact opposite effect,0
1,Russia's president perhaps walks his way out of this through consolidation at home and further assertiveness and intransigence abroad,0
1,"In his annual State of the Nation address to parliament on December 4, Putin evoked exactly that",0
5,"He called for the public's resilience in the face of hardship, and promisedto continue his foreign policy in the belief in the justness of Russia's cause and greatness",2
1,Russia's(orPutin's)convictions are anchored on several real or perceived premises,0
1, Russia believesthat the US never stoppedcontaining Russia,0
0,"Since the collapse of the Berlin wall, NATO's and the EU's borders have moved east",2
1,"Russia fearsthat Ukraine's and Georgia's expressed desireto join both organisations, risks bringing those organisations to Russia's most vulnerable borders - to the east and the south",0
5,"Inhis address condemning the ""pure cynicism"" of the West,he accused western governments ofseekingto raise a new ""iron curtain"" around Russiaand suggestedthat even ifCrimea had not been annexed,the West would have come up with a different pretextto imposesanctions to contain Russia's resurgence",2
1, Russia firmly believesthat Americans are interventionists and falsely moralistic in their discourse,0
1,They are heavily involved inusing soft powerto manipulate and shape the will of the people,0
1,whileadvocating the independence and sovereignty of states and respect of the will of those same peopleto determine their own future,0
5,"In the same speech, Putin accused the West ofmeddling in Russia's internal affairs,claimingthat sanctions were merely an excuseto weaken Russia",2
5,"Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov charged the West withseeking regime change in Moscow",2
1,"Russia has always blamed the West for its policies of interference in other countries' internal affairs, but had never before impliedthat it had worries of its own",0
1,we are faced with the possibility of another Cold War and are challengedto look for waysto avoid it,0
1,it is worthlooking into history's verdict on the original one,0
0,First there are the traditionalists of the 1960swho arguedthat the Cold War was the direct result of Stalin's aggressive Soviet expansionism,2
5,"Later on, particularly during the Vietnam War, the revisionists (William Appleman Williams) challenged that view blaming the US for the Cold War,arguing that:""America's chief aim in the years after the war wasto make surethat there was an 'open door' for American trade,andthat this led the American governmentto tryto make surethat countries remained capitalist like the United States.""",2
5,"Then there were the post-revisionists (John Lewis Gaddis) in the 1970swho believed that:""America and Russia wantedto keep the peace after the warbutthat conflict was caused by mutual misunderstanding, reactivity, and above all the American inabilityto understand Stalin's fears and needto defend himself after the war.""",2
1,The latter is the closest guide to today's problems,0
1,One of the specificities of the current period isthat the West considersRussia to be both part of the solution but part of the problemas well,0
1, Russia supports the separatists in Ukraine and is the only powerthat can influence decisions there and makethe rebels listen,0
0,"In Iran, Russia built the heavy water Arak nuclear power station",2
1,which was perceivedto be a huge problem,0
0,even asit offersto supply enriched uranium or host Iran's centrifuges as part of a solution,2
0,"In Syria, Russia backs the Assad regime",2
1,it remainsengaged in the political process and under certain circumstancescan influence Assad's decisions,0
1,The list grows even longer,0
1,one considers the conflicts in other parts of Russia's neighbourhood,0
1,"From the Moldovan to the Georgian and the Armenian- Azerbaijani conflicts, Russia has a major influence and say in the final outcomes",0
1,"As a result of this duality, the line is blurred between engagement and confrontation,creating misunderstandings and uncertainties, but also opportunities for both Russia and the US",0
1,This was not the case in the East- West standoff during the Cold War,0
1,These beliefs and perceptions are both strengths and weaknesses for one side or the other,0
1,"Taken together,they nullify each other",0
1,"In the bigger picture, inthe face of enormous global disturbances causing untold carnage and loss of life,they seem trivial",0
1,It is timethat the major players look beyond history and personalities and transcend the zero-sum thinking of the past,0
5,"US Vice-President Joe Biden told an American university audience in Octoberthat Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are responsible forarming al- Nusra, ISIL, and other al-Qaeda-rooted extremists in Syriaandthat there is no ""moderate middle"" in the country",2
0,there was(asmost non-Americans expected)little coverage of this stunning admission in the US mainstream media,2
0," what little coverage there was focused on Biden's subsequent apologies to Turkish, Emirati, and Saudi leaders forhaving made such comments in the first place",2
1,"Predictably, there was no follow-up reporting in the New York Times reminding Americansthat the US is itself complicit infunding and arming extremists in Syria",0
1,"In early 2013, the newspaper reportedwhatmany in the region already knew",0
5,"that since the beginning of 2012, the CIA had been deeply involved inprocuring weapons for anti-Assad forces, airlifting arms to Jordanian and Turkish airports, and ""vetting"" rebel commanders-all to helpUS allies ""support the lethal side of the civil war""",2
5,"Other reports pointed outthat these shipments were actually paid for by US allies, at the bidding of the Obama administration",2
1," after the Biden revelation, the so-called ""newspaper of record"" made no reference tohowthe US, in violation of international law, helpedto facilitate the Syrian civil war- and, in the process, to enable the rise of ISIL",0
1,Western-backed extremism is neither a new nor regionally-bound concept,0
1,"Whetherit is the ""Contra"" rebels in Nicaragua or al-Qaeda-like groups in Afghanistan,the objective has always beento achieve strategic objectives through the infliction of mass suffering - for, in the ""free and civilised world"" of the US and its allies,the utopian end too often justifiesthe Mephistophelean means",0
1,"More recently, an important footnote to the Libyan civil war was the involvement of Abdul Hakim Belhaj, previously the leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group as well as an al-Qaeda member",0
1,He was one of many Libyan militants influenced by a takfiri (apostate) ideology,0
0,the groupswith which he was affiliatedwere designated as terrorist organisations by the US State Department,2
1," he, along with other like-minded militants, became central components in the efforts of western and Arab-backed anti-Gaddafi forcesto capture Tripoli, the Libyan capital",0
1,"Western willingnessto cooperate with al-Qaeda (or ""former"" al-Qaeda) militants in Libyawas a major turning point",0
1,Even the subsequent death of the US ambassador to Libya did not change US policy in this regard,0
0,Belhaj became the representative of Libya's interim president after Gaddafi's overthrow (before the complete ruin of the country),2
1,"More importantly, the willingness of the US and European and ""Middle Eastern"" alliesto embrace al-Qaeda-like militantstook US and western foreign policy in the region back towhatit had been before the September 11, 2001 attacks - a policy of cooperation with violent extremiststo undermine regional actorsthe West considers problematic",0
1,This policy quickly expanded from Libya to Syria,0
1,"the repercussions are being felt today in countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, Australia, and China",0
1,"After Gaddafi's overthrow, Turkey - a NATO member - allegedly helped Belhajto meet with leaders of the so-called ""Free Syrian Army"" in Istanbul and along the Syrian-Turkish border",0
1,"In the meetings the former al-Qaeda leader discussedsupporting the FSA with money, weapons, and fighters",0
1,at a timewhenthe CIA was a major conduit for the transfer of weapons from Libya to Syria,0
1,Belhaj was just one of many al-Qaeda affiliates involved in violent anti-government campaigns in both Libya and Syria,0
1,"his openly acknowledgedrole underscoreshowthe supposedly ""moderate"" FSA was, from early on in the Syrian civil war,asIran repeatedly warned, deeply associated with and infiltrated by extremists",0
1,"Over time, the problem grew so large with ISIL's risethat it became impossibleto hide the monsterthat the US and its allies had created",0
1,"And so, Washington launched yet another chapter in its never-ending post-9/11 ""war on terror""",0
1,"Notwithstanding Washington's professed determinationto degrade and, ultimately, to destroy ISIL,Iran remains profoundly skeptical of US intentions",0
4,"Even afterdramatic gains by ISIL in Iraq and the formation of a US-led coalition of the guilty to fight it,this coalition has, on average, carried out just nine airstrikes per day in both Iraq and Syria",2
4,"In comparison, western reports indicatethat,in the same period, the Syrian air force alone has at times carried out up to 200 strikes in 36 hours",2
1,these largely inconsequential US-led airstrikes are carried out in Iraq and Syria,0
1,some regional players continueto provide extensive logistical support to ISIL,0
1,"along Syria's borders with Jordan and the Israeli regime, the Nusra Front continuesto collaborate with other extremist militias backed by foreign (including western) powers",0
1,"In light of these realities, Iranians -who have been indispensable inpreventing the fall of Damascus, Baghdad, Aleppo, and Erbil- simply do not buy the argumentthat a repentant US is now waging a real war against ISIL, the Nusra Front, and other extremist organisations in Iraq and Syria",0
1,"Rather, Iranians see the evidence aspointing to a complex (yet foolish) policy undertaken by Washington and its allies for the purpose of""containing"" the Islamic Republic",0
1,"What,then, would be the justification - under such circumstances andasIranian allies are successfully pushing back extremists in Iraq and Syria",0
1,- for the Islamic Republicto cooperate with the US in Iraq?,0
1,No matterhow muchsome may tryto tempt it,0
1,Iran will not play Faust to America's Mephistopheles,0
1,"Listen to the doomsayers, the scaremongers and the Farage brigade,andyou would be forgiven forthinkingthat London is full",0
1,"Our capital,just like our country, they say,can't cope with any more people",0
1,Everything from traffic jams to NHS waiting times is blamed on immigrants,0
1,"The only answer,they tell us,isto pull up the drawbridge and close our borders,turning our back on the globalised worldthat this country did so muchto create",0
4,"How, then,do they explain the factthat, according to forecasts, only today willLondon's population surpass that of 1939 -topping 8.6 million for the first time?",2
1,It is a stark rebuttal of the frequently peddled myththat saysLondon must stop growing,0
1,"Instead of the huge influx of immigrantsthat headlines wrongly report, in realitythe capital's population has only gradually been creeping back to the level of 75 years ago,beforethe blitz destroyed many parts of the city",0
1,"Today, though, shows more than just the falsity of the immigration scare stories",0
1,it highlights the huge success of London as a city,0
1,Our capital continuesto attract people from all over the country and all over the globebecauseof the opportunities it offers,0
1,"to find work, set down roots, enjoy a world-class cultural scene and be accepted regardless ofwho you areandwhereyou come from",0
1,"That success should be a cause of great celebration, not something to curse and tryto curtail",0
1,But no one should deny the pressuresthat come with a growing population,0
1,- pressuresthat are particularly acute in the capital,0
1,London is in the midst of the deepest housing crisis in decades,0
4,average house prices soar to 14 times the average salary and rents rise uncontrollably,2
1,"The city's transport system is strugglingto cope with demand,withcommuters crammed into conditionsin which it would be illegalto transport livestock,and fares rising year on year",0
1,"The opportunitiesto get a decent job, buy a house, and enjoyall the city hasto offerare becoming fewer",0
1,The reality is becomingdetached from the dream,0
1,These problems arise not because of growing demand alone but because of the failure of political leadersto respond to it,0
1,"Londoners have a rightto expect more from their mayor than the 17,000 new homesthat were built in the capital last year",0
1,"- less than a third of the 63,000 a yearthat are neededto solve the city's housing crisis",0
1,That Boris Johnson has missed his own affordable housing targets in every year of his mayoraltyis an abject failure of political leadership,0
1,"The government's unwillingnessto commit to vital transport infrastructure, such as Crossrail 2 and new Thames bridges,is scarcely better",0
1,History shows uswhatcan be achievedwhenpoliticians take population growth seriouslyand rise to the challengesit creates,0
1,"In the midst of the second world war,even asbombs fellandthe city burned,a plan was devisedto respond to London's growth",0
0,"The Abercrombie plan, officially called the Greater London plan, laid out an ambitious vision for a new postwar London: decent housing replacing slums, efficient transport, full employment, new parks and open spaces",2
1,It was a radical and comprehensive documentthat provided the detail forrebuilding London after the devastation of the war,0
0,New towns including Stevenage and Crawley were built in the south-east,2
0,"modern transport infrastructure, including the north and south circular roads, was plannedto cope with the increasing number of cars",2
1,The requirements of a successful London were drawn up and implemented,0
1,"A growing population and new pressures on services meanwe need a new, equally ambitious plan today",0
1,Empty words about more homes and better jobs will not cut it,0
1,"they are no substitute for a serious and detailed proposal forbuilding at least 63,000 homes a year and rebalancing the city's economyto create jobs and opportunities for Londonerswhilecontinuing to invest in the industries of tomorrow",0
1,"The city's creaking transport system must be upgraded, with Crossrail 2 and other new infrastructure built",0
1,This must happen without the continuous and excessive raising of fares,0
1,which burns holes in Londoners' pockets,0
1,"Keeping London affordable for ordinary people must be central to the plan, and improving the quality of life of Londoners a core theme",0
1,"Giventhat London successfully adapted to growing demands in the middle of a world war,we can be optimistic about our chances ofdoing the same today",0
1,We should not letthose with a political agenda useLondon's growing population to support their anti-immigration rhetoric,0
1,we should challenge thosewho wantto label London's global attraction a flaw rather than a strength,0
1,That our capital is back at its peak populationis a sign of its success as a great global city,0
2,"People from all corners of the globe still take great risks, at great expense,to become Londoners and to benefit from the city's opportunities",2
1,But this isn't a time for complacency,0
1,"Whoeverthe next mayor is,they must focus their gaze onsolving the problemsthat stem from growing demand on London's infrastructure",0

1,That'swhythe Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogation and detention after 9/11 is important,0

1,Proponents of torture are contesting these well-documented findings,0
1,So let'slook at the facts,0
1,"On 9/11, the CIA had few, if any, experienced counterterrorism interrogators",0
1,Their traditional purview had been intelligence collection during the Cold War,0

1,Do blacks trust police morethanwhites do?,0
1,"Given the anger over events in Ferguson and New York City, the very question seems absurd",0
1,But it is not,0
1,"Behind the polls and demonstrations, there is evidencethat blacks trust police at least as muchaswhites do",0
1,The poll results are hardly surprising,0
4,A new Gallup poll confirmsblacks place less confidence in police and the criminal justice system,2
4,"Using survey data from 2006 through 2014,Gallup found:.*31 percentage points more blacks than whitesbelieveblack males are more likelyto go to prison than white males primarily because of discrimination(50 percent versus 19 percent)",2
4,*7 percentage pointsmore blacks believe the honestyandethics of police are low/very low (17 percent versus 10 percent),2
4,", a 2013 Pew Research Centersurvey revealsthat 70 percent of blacks believed police treated whites better than blacks",2
4,"By contrast, only 37 percent of whites agreed",2
2,whatpeople sayandwhatthey doare often different,2
1,And there are both victims and criminals in black communities,0
1,Victims may trust the police for the same reasonsthat criminals dislike them,0
1,Blacks are not a monolithic group: blackswho who have been through the criminal justice system as criminalscould answer these questions quite differently than thosewho have relied on police as victims,0
1,The polls don't distinguish between these two groups,0
5,"As Charles Barkley recently said:""[Police]are the only thing inthe ghetto between this place being the wild, wild west.""",2
1,Most violent crime victims don't report crimes to police,0
1, only about half of rapes are reported to police,0

1,"In the case of rape, victimswho thinkthat the police are unsympathetic to rape victims or are unlikelyto solve the casesare even less likelyto report rapes",0
1,black victims really believepolice are racist,0
1,whywould they report the crime to the police?,0
1,Blacks victims don't want other blacks locked up simply due to their race,0
1,they want the criminalswho actually committed the crime punished,0
1,Of course people are more likelyto reportcrimes to policeifthey believethe police will solve them,0
1,Whywaste time filling out forms and being interviewedifthe crime isn't goingto be solved?,0
1,blacks thinkpolice are incompetent or dishonest or just don't care,0
1,again there is little reasonto turn to the police for help,0
1, blacks don't shy away fromreporting crimes to the police,0
4,Data compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statisticsfrom 2008 to 2012 showsthat blacks are actually more likelythanwhites to report violent crimes to the police-- 9 percentage points more likely than whites (54 percent to 45 percent),2
1,Blacks consistently report violent crimes at a higher ratethanwhites do,0
1,That applies to all income groups as well as for victims living in urban and suburban areas,0
1,This higher rate of reporting is true in areaswhereblacks face higher violent crime rates than whitesandalso whenthe reverse is true,0
4,The Bureau of Justice Statistics reportsthat whiteswho are below 200 percent of the poverty levelface a higher violent crime rate than blacks with the same income,2
4,blacks still report those crimes at a higher rate,2
4,"For incomes above 200 percent of poverty, blacks are more frequent victims of violent crime",2
4,again they are still more likelyto report them,2
4,"On average, blacks are victims of violent crime at much higher rates than whites",2
1,the gap isn't as largeasmany people think,0
1,"Typically, crime rate comparisons are in terms of the FBI crime data--data relying on the number of crimes reportedto police",0
1,that is misleading,0
1,becauseblacks report violent crimes at higher rates,0
4,Whilethe FBI crime numbers showblacks to have a 40 percent higher violent crime rate,2
4,the actual difference is about 30 percent,2
1,"Whenit comes to crime,the demonstrations and pundits don't reflecthowmost blacks feel most of the time",0
1,There appearsto be a silent majority of blackswho trust the police,0
1,Many blacks may get angry about particular cases in the news,0
1,"whenthey haveto turn to someone for help,they turn to the police",0

1, Ms  Dowd accused Ms  Miller ofbeing too close to her subject,0
1,"essentially ofcolluding with others, ofselling outto makesomeone happyor to further a shared agenda",0
1,It was absurd and petty,0

0,The 42-year-old French Muslim policeman was executed on the sidewalk of Paris' 11th borough - the enclavewhereCharlie Hebdo's headquarters is located,2
0,"Merabat was shot, point-blank, by one of the three assassins, minutesbeforethey broke into Charlie Hebdo's offices,and slaughtered the magazine's top editor and celebrated cartoonists",2
1,"The coverage of the ""Paris shootings"" centred almost exclusively on Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut and Bernard Verlhac - the prominent and unyieldingly provocative minds behind Charlie Hebdo",0
1,"The first victim, Ahmed Merabat, was purged from the headlines",0
1,The political and representational ramificationsthat come withhighlighting Merabat's victimhoodcannot be ignored,0
1," it complicates the broader narrativethat rigidly caricatures Muslims as terrorists, outsiders and marginals",0
1,"And second, refutes the state-sponsored indictment of Muslims in France as perpetrators of subversion, instead of law-abiding citizens",0

1,"In most everywhere in the world, but especially France - the architect of modern Islamophobia",0
1,Muslims comprise a considerable percentage of the French polity,0
4,Islam is the nation's second biggest religion,2
4,figures place the Muslim population at 5 percent to 10 percent of France's 66 million citizens,2
1,"Islam's size, and demographical rise, has spurred some of the most draconian policies against Muslims in modern times",0
0,"The headscarf ban in 2004, followed by illegalisation of the niqab, or face covering, in 2010, codified core Islamophobic ideas",2
1,This legislation also functioned as a firm and fervent declaration by the statethat Muslim and French identities were at odds and irreconcilable,0
1,The French laicite model provided the structural underpinningsto carry forward Islamophobic legislation,0
1,"But more nefariously, guise it under the banner of state-sponsored secularism",0
1,"Expectedly, the religious expression bans disparately impacted French Muslims",0
1, they chilled bodily and verbal expressions of Muslim identity,0
1,"The state aim of compelling secularisation upon its Muslim citizenry was based upon the civilisational binary, and ultimatum,to choose between ""Islam and the West"", ""Muslim lands or France""",0
1,"Despite this ultimatum handed down from the state, the overwhelming majority of French Muslims exercised their faith amid pervasive bigotry",0
1,"Extreme voices from within the state, and French civil society, looked to the three terrorists as representatives of the nation's 3 to 6 million Frenchmen and women",0
1,"Collateral indictment of French Muslims, by politicians and media alike, infused with an already fervent culture of Islamophobia on the ground, will surely incite violent backlash against Muslims and Muslim communities in the country",0
1,"Althoughunimaginable before Wednesday,French Islamophobia standsto become far more severe and strident",0
1,"The conflation of the terrorist's acts with France's Muslim population, from the perspective of hatemongers, holdsthe latter vicariously liable",0
1,"This connection,that links three deviant actors with an entire faith and millions of disconnected citizens,will fuel rabid backlash against Muslims in France, and more than likely, claim additional victims",0
1,"Centring Muslim victims, instead of villains, would mitigate the backlash considerably",0
1,"focusing on the heroics of Merabat, instead of the evil of the three terrorists,asserts - and inserts - a competing narrativethat France's Muslims are everyday citizens",0
1,"Citizens with jobs, families, and interpretations of Islamthat condemn violence, and contradict the malignant caricature of the faith constructed by the state",0
1,Ahmed Merabat was more than a victim,0
1,He was far more than merely a Muslim,0
1,"He, in both life and especially in death, stands as an archetype for the overwhelming majority of French Muslims",0
1,"A law-abiding citizen, Merabat harmonised his religious identity with the responsibilities ofbeing a Frenchman",0
0,He was both French and Muslim,2
1,"an existential integration eviscerated by the longstanding Islamophobic discourse in France, and ignored by the media firestorm following the attack",0
1,"Althoughthe first victim of the attack,Ahmed Merabat's story was shot down from the news headlines",0
1,And his name and face absent from the ongoing stream of reports and narrativesemanating from Paris on Wednesday,0
1,"Inserting him into the story, and countering the barrage of vile Muslim representations with a rebuttal of victimhood and valour,will likely save lives in France",0

0,"Twenty five years ago on December 20, 1989, El Chorrillo, an Afro-Panamanian neighbourhood in the centre of Panama city was the scene of a criminal assault by the military forces of the United States government",2

0,Significant elements of the outgunned Panamanian defence forces had barracks in the El Chorrillo community,2

5,"As Marta Sanchez and otherswho experiencedthe assault remembered,the people of El Chorrillo,whose descendants came from the Caribbean to Panama as cheap labourto build the canal,never knewwhathit themwhenthey awoke to the sounds of machine gun fire from the 82nd Airborne division",2
0,"Whenthe firing stoppedandthe smoke from the fires finally subsided,thousands were deadandthe neighbourhood largely destroyed",2
1,"""Black Lives Matter"" is a refrainwhose importanceis reflective of the valuethat black people place on our lives",0
1,we must disabuse ourselves of the illusionthat black lives or any other lives matterwhenthey stand in the way of the political and capital interests of US elitesandthat it is not limited to black communities in the US,0
5,"As human rightsstrategist Ajamu Baraka points out:""The black lives taken by the murderous assault on Panama 25 years ago should be a sober reminderthat US state violence is not confined to ghettoes and barrios of the US but is a central component of the racist, colonial, capitalist projectthat is the US.We cannot pretend that police brutality in the USandthe devaluation of black lifethat it representsis restricted just to the black experience in the heart of the US empire.""",2
1,The attack on Panama and the massive loss of life and destruction was a harbinger of the lawlessness and aggressionthat would characterise US policies in the unipolar world of the late 20th and early 21st century,0
1,"WhenPresident Noriega failedto supportUS efforts to destabilise Nicaraguaand had the audacityto publicly defy the US state with his defiant rhetoric,Bush had a perfect opportunityto establish the terms forwhathe referred to as a new world order of unchecked US power",0
1,Panama became a demonstration projectto communicate to the nations of the global souththat resistance to US hegemony would be met with ferocious violence,0
1,The factthat scores of black lives would be lost as part of the demonstrationwas of no consequence to the policymakers of hegemony,0
1,The structures and relations of repression are linked from the centre of the empire to its periphery states,0
2,"US police forces train police departments throughout the world through programmes such as the International Taskforce Agent Training, (conducted by US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations) including police officersthat work in communities like El Chorrillo",2
1,"The US police forces bring with them their military, interrogation, intimidation and racially biased tactics",0
1,which involve use of excessive force on civilians,0
1,"It is also internationally knownthat police are quickerto use force, shoot and kill black people, the same waythat the US is quickto invade smaller countries with less power",0
1,"becausein the scope of the political reality, they matter less",0
1,Violence is integral to the project of western colonial capitalist domination from Palestine to Ferguson,0
5,"""On this 25th anniversary of the US invasion of Panama, we needto rememberthat the struggle for black liberation is ongoing.US authorities must be madeto understandthat the value of black life is not determined by the bordersthat those black bodies find themselves.The destruction in Panama is a reminder to my generationthat our demand is not new,""says Alicia Garza, National Domestic Workers Special Projects director and cofounder of #BlackLivesMatter",2
1,"Whilewe remember the victims of the US invasion of Panama,the families of the thousands of victims of US criminality in Panama are still demanding justice and accountability 25 years later",0
1,"Like the families of Eric Garner and Mike Brown and the victims of police violence in the US, they are part of the long line of victims of US criminality globally",0

5,"Following the reports of Iranian aircraft attacking ISIL targets last week, Iranian and US officials issued statementsto emphasisethat they are not coordinating their air strikes",2
1,"Despite these denials, there is an ironic element to this strikethat both sides cannot deny",0
0,"The Islamic Republic of Iran used US-produced, Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom aircraft against a common foe, ISIL",2
1,Contextualising these Iranian air strikes within the greater history ofhowthese planes ended up in the Iranian air force in the first placedemonstrates a geostrategic reality for US foreign policy,0
1,"Iran's geographical depth meansthe US has needed Iran during both the Cold War and post-Cold War era, regardless of the government in Tehran",0
0,The Islamic Republic's fleet of F-4s and F-14s were inherited from the Royal Iranian Air Force of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,2
1,"Iran under the shah was one of the few US alliesthat could purchase the advanced F-14 Tomcat interceptor of ""Top Gun"" fame, with one of the most sophisticated radars at the time",0
1,"The shah's shopping list of US-supplied aircraft boosted the economy of the US defence industry, as well as served US geopolitical interests during the Cold War",0
1,Iran's advanced military allowedit to emerge as a regional hegemon,0
2,Sinceit shared a long border with the Soviet Union,2
1,"the shah's armed forces served as a bulwark against Communist penetration in the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf region, and a deterrent against an anti-western Baathist Iraq",0
1,Iran's geostrategic location has not diminished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union,0
1,"No US or NATO ally, including Israel, Turkey or Saudi Arabia can cover Iran's geographical depth",0
1,"Iran's location meansit can influence events from Iraq to the Gulf, from the Caucasus and adjoining Caspian and Black Seas to Central Asia, and from Afghanistan to South Asia",0
1,The video footage released by Al Jazeera of Iranian F-4sattacking ISIL forces in Iraq's Diyala provinceis reminiscent of another attack,0
0,"whentwo of the same US-supplied Iranian aircraft bombed Iraq's nuclear facility in Tuwaitha in 1980, during the first year of the Iran-Iraq War",2
1,"In this first air strike, the US and the Islamic Republic shared the same interests, albeit for different purposes",0
1,The Islamic Republic fearedIraq could develop a nuclear option,0
0,"asit fought a two-front war for its survival, including a domestic Iranian Kurdish uprising,anda potential pro-shah counterrevolution launched from within the Iranian air force - the same unitthat was neededto target Iraq",2
1,"The US, despite its tensions with Iran during the hostage crisis, did not wantto seeIraq develop a nuclear capabilitythat could threaten its ally Israel during the 1980s",0
0,Israel successfully followed up the attack against Iraq's nuclear facility in 1981,2
1,the US-led air strikes during the 1991 Gulf war were designedto destroy this nuclear infrastructure again,0
0,which had been rebuilt despite the Israeli air raid,2
1,Thus the air raid Iran conducted against ISIL was not the first timeboth Washington and the Islamic Republic might have both wished for a successful sortie of Iranian F-4 pilots,0
0,"Despite this common interest during the Iran-Iraq War, the US titled towards Iraq and directly engaged Iranian naval forces in the Gulfto protect Kuwaiti oil vessels,downing an Iranian civilian aircraft in the process",2
0,Iran fought a proxy war against US forces in Iraq following the 2003 Iraq war bysupporting Iraqi militias during the insurgency,2
1,Both the US and Iran will continueto clash over their respective relationships with Israel,0
0,Yet despite these differences both the US and Iran cooperated with each otherto remove the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001,2
1,"The joint cause against the Taliban in 2001, or ISIL in 2014, demonstratesthat despite the decades-long mistrust and proxy conflicts between the two sides, geographical realpolitik can forceboth states to engage in alliances of convenience",0
5,"In an AP interview, the new US ambassador in Baghdad, Stuart Jones said,""Let's face it.Iran is an important neighbour to Iraq.There hasto be cooperation between Iran and Iraq.""",2
1,Such a statement is significant,0
1,The Iranian government has been tryingto forcethe US to concede this geographic fact since 2003,0
1,This statement serves as indirect evidencethat the US and Iran appearto have worked out a modus vivendi indealing with ISIL in Iraq,0
0,"whenAl Jazeera released the video of the air strike,the Iranian government initially denied the report,only to confirm it days later,adding the caveatthat it was launched at the behest of the central government in Iraq",2
1,The initial denial raises the question as towhetherIran did not wantto upset this alliance of convenience with USbylaunching its own air strikes,0
1,"In this case, rather thanupsetting the US,both the Iranian and Iraqi governments probably wantedto keepthis air strike quiet for domestic Iraqi politics",0
1,"The close cooperation between the post-2003 Iraqi government and Iran has been criticised by critics within Iraq over the last decade as a surrender of Baghdad to ""Safavis"", a reference to the 16th century Shia dynasty in Iranthat triedto securewhatis today Iraq from the Ottomans",0
1,"This footage, along with pictures of Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Quds Force,training Iraqi forces on Iranian equipment used by both the Iraqi military and Shia militias,have only alienated Iraq's disenfranchised communities withwhom Baghdad needsto ultimately reconcile",0
1,This modus vivendi over Iraq will hinge on the future of the ongoing nuclear negotiations and the Syrian civil war,0
1,"But in both cases, there could be an endgamethat resolves the mutual antagonisms between Iran and the US",0
1,"Media coverage acknowledgesthat despite Iranian-US cooperation in Iraq, they still support rival sides in the Syrian civil war",0
1," even in that conflict, they do share a mutual desire for that conflictto end with a political solution",0
1,Such a solution will save Iran from the huge financial costs ofsubsidising the Syrian militaryand end a conflictthat the US has been hesitantto engage in since its onset in the summer of 2011,0
5,"Al Jazeera's correspondent in Iraq, Imran Khan, in an article in November raised the question:Are the US and Iran on the same side in Iraq?",2
1,"The answer to this question is not only a ""yes"" in Iraq, but could also be a ""yes"" in terms of the long-term stability of Syria and Afghanistan",0
1,It is domestic politics in both the US and Iranthat prevent any official fromsaying this publicly,0
1,Moscow's latest tests of intercontinental missiles and its parading of nuclear capable strategic bombers have rightly prompted international concern,0
0,"In December 2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov impliedthat Russia might be moving nuclear weapons to Crimea",2
1,"From violations of airspace to near mid-air collisions, the number of incidents between Russia and NATO has soared dramatically",0
1,increasing the danger of an unintended escalation,0
1," it is rarely mentionedthat NATO, too, is back in the game of nuclear deterrence",0

1,"we can only speculate, for the exact location of these approximately 180 air-launched B61 weaponsis of course secret",0
0,The local baker smiles uneasilywhenI ask her about the base and is quickto assure methat there is nothingto see,2

0,"Suddenly, a jet plane soars into the sky with a deafening thunder",2
1,"In the event of a nuclear war, it would most likely be heading East from here",0
1,"Designed in the 1960s for use by high-speed aircraft,the thermonuclear B61 is a versatile weaponthat comesboth as an intermediate range strategicand a short-range tactical weapon with a wide variety of yields",0

1,"in that its stationing and delivery also involves non-nuclear member states,such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey",0
1,Tactical nukes are particularly problematic,0
1,becausetheir short range provides the missing link between a localised conventional war and a highly improbable global exchange of strategic nuclear missiles between Moscow and Washington,0
1,Tactical nuclear weapons are no status quo weapons,0
1,Their battlefield purpose increases the chance of a nuclear escalation,0
1,which iswhythe superpowers removed most of them from Central Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s,0
1,everything goesto plan,0
1,the controversial B61 weapons will be modernised by around 2020,0
1,"This ""life extension programme"" is not simplyan initiative to replace rusty old nukes with shiny new ones,butan attempt to increase their accuracy,to replace free fall with precision guided bombs",0
1,"Ultimately, this will transform the B61 into a new kind of weapon and undermine any pretencethat the West is still in the game of denuclearisation",0
1,"Interestingly, plansto modernise the B61were initiated in April 2010, only shortlyafterNATO decidedto scrap its nuclear missile shield in Eastern Europe and in the same monththat the two largest nuclear powers signed a new Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty",0
1,"Howdoes NATO explain this nuclear relapse precisely at a timewhenthe alliance had just ""reset"" its relationswith Russia?",0
1,And what roledoes the B61 play in the Ukrainian proxy war?,0
1,"Jamie Shea is famous in Brussels for his rhetorical skill, expressive body language and London twang",0
5,"""He could sellyou a landmineifhe wanted to"",an activist once told me about the man",2
0,who spun NATO's war against Serbia to a lethargic European public 15 years ago,2
0,The alliance's Deputy Assistant Secretary General has come to University College Londonto talk to students about the Ukrainian crisis and Europe's new security architecture,2
1,Shea tells the story of an underfunded alliancethat urgently needsto up its military game,0
0,it wantsto stand up to Putin's Russia,2
0,"He is excited about NATO's new ""very high readiness joint task force"" and about new and larger planned NATO manoeuvrrs in Eastern Europe",2
1,One topiche has precious littleto say aboutis the alliance's nuclear policy,0
1,I prompt him,0
0,",Shea explainsthat whilethe life extension programme was originally meantto provide NATO with a bargaining chip for future nuclear disarmament talks with the Kremlin,Russia's involvement in Eastern Ukraine fundamentally altered the strategic context,renderingthe B61 ""once again a part of NATO's deterrence posture""",2
5,"""I'm not nostalgic for the Cold War"",he laughs,""butyou haveto prepareforCold War mark twoeven ifyou don't want it""",2
1,"In this, Shea is on the same page as US Secretary of State John Kerry",0
5,"who recently claimedthat the crisis in Ukraine was calling NATO""back to the rolethat this alliance was originally createdto perform""",2
1,"Whythis relapse towhatShea calls""the nuclear game""?",0
1,The first part of the answer lies in NATO's recent failures,0
1,"Clearly, the stand off with Russia is a welcome distraction from its fiasco in Afghanistan and the alliance's lack of a purpose in the absence of Milosevic or Gaddafi",0
1, there is more to this than just an identity crisis,0
5,"NATO,asTrine Flockhardt so aptly puts it,is something of a ""nuclear addict""",2
1,it hangs on to its nuclear weapons despitefrequently declaring its desireto abandon them,0
1,Both US President Obama and NATO's new General Secretary Stoltenberg are known advocates of nuclear disarmament,0
1,in 2014their alliance is stepping up its nuclear deterrence,0
0,the US administration is pouring $1trn into the future of its nuclear weapons systems,2
1,"There are obvious pressures behind this nuclear habit, from the nuclear arms industry via hawkish politicians and generals to certain Eastern European NATO members",0
1,the real issue is a lack of public scrutiny,0
1,"In the UK, the debate about nuclear weapons tendsto concentrate on Britain's nuclear submarinesandwhatwould happen to themifScotland declared independence",0
1,The US is currently preoccupied with the safety of its nuclear silos,0
1,These issues are of course important,0
1,they should not causeus to overlook NATO's nuclear relapse,0
1,People like Shea publicly admit their reliefthat the public has kept so quiet about nuclear weapons since the end of the Cold War,0
1, governments remember all too well their predecessors' struggles with the peace and anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s,0

1,"Twenty-five years after its fall, the Berlin wall is one of the world's most heavily memorialised sites, a tourist attraction like few other 20th century structures",0
1,"the wall remains the symbol of the Cold War in schoolbooks, op-eds and emotive speeches",0
1,it is also a highly problematic one,0
1,"Rather thanrepresenting the threat of mutual nuclear annihilation,it always stood for a much simpler lesson - that of the West's moral victory over the ""prison"" of real existing socialism",0

1,we needto look elsewhere,0
1,A visitor to villagesthat lie near nuclear weapons storage sites in Europemight be surprisedto be greeted by American flags in shop windows and front gardens,0
1,This form of identification with US nuclear weapons is puzzling giventhat these sites would be primary targets in the event of a nuclear war with Moscow,0
1,The West is currently too preoccupied with Russia's new nuclear militarismto notice the way that its own military alliance functions as an agent of regional insecurity,0
1,"NATO never abandoned its ""first use"" doctrine",0
1,It does not rule out the possibility ofbeing firstto go nuclear in an armed conflict with another nuclear power,0
1,"Some will arguethat ""now is not the time""to start a public debate on NATO's tactical nukes",0

1,Most alarming is the concernthat foreign-run Ebola treatment centres could be using unorthodox testing methods with impunity,0
0,Emergency's use of Amiodarone without a proper clinical trial or patient consent prompted censure from a senior scientist about the recklessness of this approach and a walk-out over safety fears by the UK health workers sentto work at the treatment centre,2
0,"Apparently, the NGO stoppedusing the drug afterreceiving a request from the Department of International Development (DFID)",2

1,there is a long history of unethical drug testing on poor and vulnerable communities across the globe,0
1,Perhaps one of the most famous cases of unethical experimental treatment was in 1932,0
0,"Public Health Service in the United States began the ""Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male"" at a timewhenthere was no known cure for syphilis",2
4,The study initially included 600 black men - 399 with and 201 without syphilis ,2
0,"most of whom were poorandilliterate sharecroppers enticed with incentives such as free medical exams, meals on examination days, and promisesthat their relatives would receive burial stipends in the event of their deaths",2
0,"The men were deceived intothinkingthat they were being treated for ""bad blood""",2
0,They neither received proper treatment nor werethey informed of the true nature of the study,2
0,"Instead oflasting for six months,asoriginally projected,the study went on for 40 years",2
0,Whenpenicillin was developedto treat syphilis in 1947,2
0,treatment was withheld from all 600 subjects,2
0,"In 1973, a class action suit was filed on behalf of the men in the study and settled out of court for $9 million",2
0,Similar experiments were held in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948,2
0,"Public Health Service infected 1,610 total soldiers, female commercial sex workers, prisoners and mental health patients with one of three sexually transmitted diseases - syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chancroid",2
0,"Like the Tuskegee experiment, none of the human subjects were informed about the nature of the study",2
0,nordid they give consent,2
0,"Unlike the Tuskegee study, however, patients in Guatemala were eventually inoculated with penicillin",2
1,it is unclearhow manywere actually cured,0
1,Althoughvulnerable adult populations have borne the brunt of unethical medical testing,0
1,children have not been spared,0

0,"Pfizer eventually settled out of court in 2009,promisingto pay the Kano state government $75 million",2
1,"For too long, the bodies of poor and vulnerable communities have been exploitedto serve the medical fetishes of big pharmaceutical companies, research institutions and Western governments",0
1, there is a growing tide against this warped practice,0
0,"In his 2014 Reith lecture series entitled 'The Future of Medicine', renowned surgeon, writer and public health researcher Dr Atul Gawande argued convincinglythat the well- being of a patient is more important than his/her ""health""",2
1," the goal of medical practice should be ""caring"",andnot simply ""curing""",0
1,"In the age of Ebola, it appearsthat the single-minded pursuitto ""cure""has somehow superseded the Hippocratic Oathto which doctors must adhereto ""do no harm""",0
1,The sudden raceto find an antidote for Ebola- a diseasethat has been around since 1976- must not serve as an excuse to experiment on patientswhose internal organs are at risk ofshutting down,0

1,"dealing with other oil producing countries with problematic states, such as Nigeria,would seem like a walk in the park",0

1,"prior to any private investment drive, an international judicial cooperation effort startsdismantling the vast organised crime networks within the Mexican oil business and beyond",0
1,"This international judicial cooperation must entail the actual implementation of a serious anti-corruption programme within the Mexican state with much broader conflict of interest and traffic of influence statutes,all monitored by reputable international civil society organisations",0
1, the failure of the Mexican state needsto be corrected with the installation of autonomous investigative units for economic crimes within each Mexican region and the creation of witness protection programmes for cases of political corruption linked to organised crime,0

1,Some of these factors are beyond their control,0
1, policemen are underpaid and ill-equippedto do their job,0
1,"others seemto be an institutional choice, such as the endemic corruption within the police force",0
1,"Under the previous constitution, the police were at the beck and call of the executive",0
1,which used it as a tool of coercionto further its political goals,0
1,"whenconfronted by a new security situation,the executive's default response has beento set up a ""special"" police unitto address the situation",0
1,"In most cases, t heunit would operate under minimum oversight and maximum impunity",0
1,"More than any other institution in the country, the police has deep institutional problems",0
1,one of the most detrimental ones is its involvement in extrajudicial killings.,0
1,"Remarkably, this is not only a new phenomenon",0
1,it is deeply entrenched with a clear pattern,0
0,"In the 1990s, crime was on the rise in Kenya",2
0,"In orderto stem the high rates of carjacking and violent robberies,in 1995 the government formeda new police unit called the Flying Squad.",2
0,This special unit was given the express authorityto shoot any suspect on sight without due process,2
1,"As a result, the unit was implicated in multiple and egregious extrajudicial killings",0
1,which they claimedwas their way ofdealing with the new security reality,0
0,"In some cases, the police officers were caughtshooting suspectsafterthey had surrendered or were lying face down",2
1,The unit executed several innocent people in cold blood,0
1,"The police command instead ofseeing the unit's trigger-happy attitude as dangerous,celebrated it as the only ""medicine"" withwhich to treat spiralling crime",0
1,"The late 1980s and 1990s saw deep economic problems,shrinking political space for dissent and increasing insecurity",0
1,This was the timewhencriminal gangs emerged and flourished,0
1,"These gangs e stablishedtheir ""spheres of influence""",0
1,"mostly in slum areas,wherethe state's presence was negligible",0
1,"To establish loyalty from the community and enhance their legitimacy,these groups provided security for a token fee",0
1,"To exert their superiority, from time to time,these groups engaged each other over ""territories"" and business interests",0
0,"Among these groups were the Mungiki, the Taliban, the Kosovo boys, the Baghdad boys, Chinkororo, and the Kalenjin Warriors",2
0,Mungiki is a Kikuyu word for multitude,2
1,The organisation had both a cultural and political element to it,0
1,"In the beginning of the group's existence,the social aspect was more prominent",0
0,it involved traditional Kikuyu beliefs in the god named Ngai.,2
1,"asthe organisation expanded,it begantaking an overtly political posture",0
1,which brought them into confrontation with the state,0
0,"Mungiki operated primarily in the Nairobi slums, in the Central Province and parts of the Rift Valley",2
1,"In these areas, the group startedproviding the poor in slum areas with protection and social services for a fee",0
1,"Refusalto pay the protection "" tax "" almost alwaysresulted in violence and killings",0
0,"In 2002, the Kenyan government banned 18 of these criminal gangs",2
0,The spread of Mungiki's influence forced the government in 2007to establish a special police unit called Kwekwe,2
0,which was tasked primarily withhunting down members of Mungiki,2
1,But Kwekwe's operation against the criminal group went too far,0
5,"According to a National Commission on Human Rights 2008 report:""Extrajudicial executions and other brutal acts of extreme cruelty have been perpetrated by the police against so-called Mungiki adherents andthat these acts may have been committed pursuant to official policy sanctioned by the political leadership, the police commissioner and top police commander""",2
5,"HRW observed in 2008that,""The brutality of the police crackdown matched or even exceeded that of the Mungiki itself.""",2
1,Kenya has been in the crosshairs of the transnational jihadi movement,0
1,"In the past, the factthat Kenya was seen asbeing firmly in the western sphere of influencemade Kenya a target , with most of the incidents, including the 1998 US embassy attack, targeting western interests",0
1," after Kenya's intervention in Somalia in 2011, the country itself become a target",0
0,Terrorism activity in Kenya reached a peak with the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in September 2013,2
0,unidentified gunmen killed 67 people and injured almost 200 others,2
0,"As a response to the growing terrorism threat, the Kenyan government created the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) in March 2003, following the 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned Mombasa hotel",2
0,This was also accompanied by the passage of Anti-Terrorism Act in 2012,2
1,"As part of the wider counterterrorism effort, the government also began a huge crackdo wn on the Somali and Muslim communities especially in Nairobi, parts of Northern Kenya and coastal Kenya",0
0,"the crackdown intensified,a number of extrajudicial killings of Muslim preachers took place, some in the coastal city of Mombasa",2
1,Most of the victims were suspected ofhaving connections with Somalia's al-Shabab group,0
1,in almost all the cases the police deny culpability,0
1,research by human rights organisations reveals the ATPU's involvement,0
5,"In its August 2014 report,""Kenya: Killings, disappearance by anti-terror police,"" HRW points to"" ...evidence of at least 10 cases of extrajudicial killings of terrorism suspects,some of whom were last seen in ATPU custody or had been threatened by the unit's officers after courtshad released them""",2
5,The Kenyan government has accused some of the clericswho were killed ofrecruiting Muslim youth for terrorism activities through their mosques,2
0," despiteinitiating investigations against them,the government never followed throughto prosecute the imams",2
0,"After public outcry over the killing of Muslim cleric Ibrahim ""Rogo"" Omar, the government set up a task forceto investigate his murder",2
0,"The director of public prosecution promised in 2013that he will institute an inquest, but has not done so yet",2
0,"One of the commissions established following the 2007-2008 violenceto look at the role of the police,was the Waki Commission",2
5,"Establishedto look into the circumstances and facts surrounding the violence and provide recommendations,the Waki Commission foundthat of the 1,500 deaths, the police was responsible for more than 30 percent of them",2
1,"As a result several reform measures were proposed including the establishment of a civilian oversight of the police, and many other reforms",0
1," due to lack of political will, the police reforms have stalled",0
1,The extrajudicial killings by the police in Kenya are anchored in a systemic lack of accountability and deeply entrenched culture of pervasive impunity,0
1,the police undoubtedly face everchanging security challenges,0
1,its involvement in extrajudicial killings makematters worse,0
1,Effective security sector reform is the only way forward,0
1,"The annual Christmas parade in Piedmont, Alabama is a big deal in this small town tucked away in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains",0

1,Little didthe mayor knowthat his town was aboutto be infested with an ill- tempered gaggle of atheists from Wisconsin - the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF),0
5,They allegedthat a single person in Piedmont had complained about the parade theme,2
0,the FFRF sent the mayor a threatening letter,2
5,"The theme ""alienates non-Christians and others in Piedmontwho do not in fact have a 'strong belief in prayers'byturning them into political outsiders in their own community,""FFRF attorney Andrew Seidel wrote",2
5,"""The sentiment of 'KeepingChrist in Christmas'does not qualify as a secular celebration.""",2
5,"They told the cityto find a ""more appropriate, more inclusive, and constitutional theme"" for the parade",2
1,It's not the first timethat the perpetually offended atheists have targeted Piedmont,0
0,"Earlier this year, they demandedthat the local high school stopreciting prayers before football games",2
5,"""Somebodyfiled a complaintandwe hadto stop that,""the mayor said",2
1,to be accurate- they sort of stoppedpraying,0
0,from that point on folks would gather on the football field before the game,2

5,"""One week we had the entire football field encircled by people",2
5,"It was really wonderful and very moving to meto seepeople come together and praise Godand speak His name out loud.""",2
1,The prayer controversy was one of the reasonswhythe parade committee wantedto make a statement during the Christmas parade,0
5,"Unfortunately, the city attorney told the mayorthat the theme violated the law",2
1,there was nothingthey could do,0
1,But the folks around Piedmont are not the kind of folkswho back away from a fight,0

5,"""It'sa positive march",2
5,it's not a protest march,2
5,"They are keepingthe theme aliveeven thoughlegally we hadto do away with it.""",2
1,The mayor is a kind-hearted fellow,0
1,but he's not oneto be trifled with,0
1,he's none too pleased with the out-of-town atheists,0
5,"""Itannoys methat a small group of people can dowhatthey doand get away with itandthe majority hasto suffer,""the mayor said",2
5,"""They are infringing on my beliefs.""",2
1,And he also had some words of advice for the one person in townwho complained,0

5,"""Ifthey don't like a Christian theme,ifthey don't like a Christian parade-stay at home.""",2

1,"Tuesday's willful, unnecessary and gratuitously destructive release of the one-sided ""torture report"" at the insistence of outgoing Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.(backed by the White House) amounts to nothing less thanproviding aid and comfort to the enemy in wartime",0
1,Can anyone cite one practical good accomplished byreleasing this gratuitously destructive report at this time?,0
1,Will revealing successful practices makeus more secure?,0
1,The report provides a propaganda windfall for Islamist fanatics,0

0,"Over the decades, I've respected Senator Feinstein,even whendisagreeing with her",2
1, I'm far more shocked by her self-serving release of this reportthanby anything the CIA didto protect us,0
1,One can only concludethat the senator and her acolytes are attemptingnot to reform our intelligence practicesbutto re-write their own role inwhattranspired,0
1,The senator and her colleagues (from both parties) were briefed in detail on every activityfield agents tookto protect us from further attacks,0
1,The senator and her colleagues (as well as the Department of Justice) approved every one of those practices,0
0,"the senator's saying,""Even ifwe knew,we didn't know.""",2
1,"Perhaps she is, indeed,suffering a much-delayed attack of conscience",0
1,the awarenessthat the incoming Republican-majority Congress would never release such a biased reportsurely plays a role,0
1,"And is it an accidentthat the report's release--the stuff of commanding headlines--has been timed for the daythat Professor ""Americans-are-stupid"" Jonathan Gruber testifies on Capitol Hill about ObamaCare?",0

1,"They were upset--infuriated--by the collapse of the Twin Towers and the deaths of 3,000 Americans",0
1," the release of this report just now--which may lead to the deaths of more Americans,asthe senator has been warned--is another sign of the Obama administration's desperation",0

1,But the average Americans so disdained by this White House(and by Professor Gruber)wantto knowwhatPresident Obama has done for them,0
1,one belongs to an arcane interest group,0
1,"the answer is ""Nothing.""",0
1,we grant her the noblest intentions,0
1,Senator Feinstein has betrayed our country and its defenders,0
1,Will she accept responsibility for the aftermath of this report's release?,0
1,The president certainly won't,0
1,the White House will give the senator a back-massage by a bus this holiday season,0
1,"Our enemies would gladly exterminate every man, woman and child in the United States",0
1,Senator Feinstein just handed them a gift,0
1,But the president wrapped it,0
1,This week marks a new era in American government,0
0,"For the first time in the six years of the Obama administration, Republicans took the reins of power in both houses of Congress,bringing divided government to our nation's capital",2
1,"With this new power comes not only responsibility, but also real challenges and opportunities",0
1,"Yes, the newly empowered Republicans in the Senate have the abilityto control the floor and tryto break through some of the gridlock and dysfunction associated with the failed tenure of nowMinority Leader Harry Reid",0
1,"Instead ofbottling up all the legislationthat's been passed by the GOP House withoutever lettingit see the light of day,Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can startmoving things forward with up or down votes and a full, fair and thorough amendment process",0
5,He has pledgedto get back to regular order and help re-establish trust between the American people and Congress,2
1,"But even more importantly, the Senate can getto work on the issues of real importance to the peoplewho elected them",0
1,"Instead ofpushing petty, politically motivated bills, or not voting justto protect one of the Democratic members fromtaking a tough vote,the Senate can focus on thingsthat will have a direct impact on the American people",0
1,I am encouragedto seethat the Keystone XL Pipeline is on the top of the docket,0
1,"This common-sense, environmentally sound project will not only create good-paying jobs for both unions and non-union members,it will also increase our domestic supply of oil, helpingto keep prices low and more money in people's pockets",0
1,it will helpto reduce the influence of foreign governments,0
1,It's unfortunatethat President Obama continuesto impede progress on Keystoneand is standing with the radical fringe of his party rather than the overwhelming majority of the country,0
1,"now that the elections for leadership are over,House Speaker John Boehner needsto move immediatelyto unite his caucus and focus on the overwhelming areas of agreement within the GOP",0
1,"Giventhat Republicans now boast their largest House majority since the late 1920s,it's not surprisingthat there have been, and will be, minor areas of difference within the caucus",0
1,But the thingsthat unite usare so much more plentiful,0
1,it's now the job of Speaker Boehnerto focus on these issues,0
1,"I was heartenedto see the House Republicans roll out a series of bipartisan jobs bills this week,including legislation calledthe ""Hire More Heroes Act.""",0
1,This bill would exempt veterans already enrolled in health care plans from the VA or Department of Defense fromcounting toward the employer mandate under ObamaCare,0
1,This is a win-win for both veterans and small businesses,0
1,Many businesses are not hiring because of ObamaCare's many mandates and new regulations,0
1,this measure would be a good first stepto help alleviate that problem,0
1, Republicans in Congress haveto prove to the American peoplethat they are responsible leaderswho will put our country's interests first bybeing ableto lead and get real results,0
1,They needto showthat they have learned from the mistakes of the pastand will stop lurching fromcliff to cliff and forcing self-imposed government shutdownsthat only tarnish the GOP brand and makeit harderto win future elections,0
1,The new Republican Congress needsto makeit impossible for the Democratsto falsely portray the Grand Old Party as a group of fire-breathing extremists focused on divisive social issues,0
1,"History tells usthat whenwe focus on the issuesthat really matter-- such as low taxes, getting our debt and deficit undercontrol, limited government, returning power to the states and a strong and muscular national defense-- the American people are with us",0
1,we win elections as a result,0
1,"The simple reality isthat even with a GOP Senate, there is only so much of President Obama's destructive agendathat we can work onrepealing these next two years",0
1,Getting rid of ObamaCare and rolling back his overreaching executive orders and memos--that's not goingto happenifa Democratic president succeeds the current occupant in January 2017,0
1,"We Republicans have a slew of talented candidateswho, over the next few months, will throw their hats into the ring and begin the process ofrunning for the White House",0
1,The new GOP Congress needsto make sureit provides critical support and issue-oriented ammunitionfor our nominees --not become unwelcome distractionsthat will hurt the brandand increase the Democrats' chances ofretaining the White House,0
1,"Let's makethese next two years count,so that in January of 2017 a newly elected Republican president can take power with robust GOP majorities in Congress and really get this country back on the right path",0
1,2014 was a year marked by greater division between groups of AmericansthanI can remember in my adult life,0
0,Racial tensions resurfaced in violent protests following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner,2
0,"New York City's mayor and police split ranks over the mayor's commentthat his biracial son faced perpetual danger from police officers, followed by the assassination of two New York City police officers",2
1,The gap in wealth between the richer and poorer segments of Americans widenedto record levels,0
1,"The Democratic and Republican parties became more polarized -- with gun rights, immigration, abortion and health insurance leading peoplenot only to argue the issues more vehemently with people from the other party, but to feellikethey might have little in common with people from the other party, period",0
1,"Whetherone supports President Obama or not,I believemost people would agreeour nation is more dividedthanit waswhenhe took office",0
1,White and black Americans may have thoughtthey were electing a black leaderwho could unite the country,0
1,that seemedto point to an American future of unity and promise,0
1,But something went horribly wrong,0
1,"To my eye, it wasas ifthe president's own unhealed wounds were ripping open the wounds of our nation",0
1,"So it makesme wonder:Whatdowe Americans really have in common,whetherblack or white, rich or poor,young or old?",0
1,Whatshould we remember about one anotherthat could bind us togetherwhileaggressivelyarguing the political and social issuesthat threatento pull us apart?,0
2, we are all human beings,2
2,which meanswe all suffer,2
2,"None of us avoids pain,whetherfrom trauma or loss",2
2,"and just the chapters of our life storiesin which we have felt powerless againstloved ones falling ill, or falling ill ourselves, should remind usthat we are all intensely vulnerable at all times",2
1,Our vulnerability meansthat we owe a duty of care to one another,0
1,The universal capacityto hurtis only the flip side of our calling to compassion ,0
1,which is closely aligned with our capacityto heal,0
1,"We should, therefore, debate vigorously, but with this in mind",0
1,"There are very few issuesthat would keep us on grandstands or podiums or behind television cameras or microphonesif,God forbid,we got a call from a doctor with very bad news about our health or -- far worse, in my mind -- the health of our children",0
1,How violentwould protests beifprotesters knewthat a few dozen of the police officers standing guard in the streets had sick or disabled kids at home?,0
1, I believeall human beings are born with the capacity for good,0
1,Every single one,0
1,No exceptions,0
1,And I believeit is a profound tragedywhenthat capacity is not realized,0
1,So think about this,0
1,"How much more carewould we taketo tryto support parents, evenwhentheir children run horribly afoul of the law,ifwe imagined our own children, broken by forces in their communities or their families or their fragile psyches, paying the price at 17 or 19 and being locked behind bars, alone, for years?",0
1,"The loss of Michael Brown -- to the streets, or unwieldy forces in his psyche, or to a bullet -- is everyone's loss",0
1,The loss of two New York City police officers -- to the twisted rage of a twisted man -- is everyone's loss,0
1,"And even the suicide of that murderer,who started out as a baby and infant and child with no designs, whatsoever, on the life of another --is everyone's loss",0
1,"We are all bleeding, all of the time",0
1,This is the human condition,0
1, I believeall Americans share the roughly 238-year struggle -- still ongoing -- for Americato realize her greatest self,0
1,"This struggle, after a War of Independence and through a Civil War and two World Wars and a host of other bloody conflicts inside our boundaries and beyond our boundaries, unites us on a path toward a more perfect unionthat mirrors every individual's path toward a more perfect self",0
1,"This struggle is part of every American's story, woven into our historical and emotional DNA",0
1,perhaps(scientists now tell us)literally encoded in the amino acidsthat make up our actual DNA,0
2,"Yes, we become enraged with one another",2
2,"Yes, we argue passionately about the future of America",2
1,These things are inevitable,0
1,They are even necessarywhenthe stakes are freedom and the future,0
1,"But it might serveus well to rememberthat ifevery one of us can grieveandevery one ofus can sufferandevery one of us is mortalandevery one of us has the capacity for compassion and every one of usis an inextricable part of this wholewe call America,that we are brothers and sisters,as surely as ifwe shared a single home, the same last name and the same skin",0
1,"Letthe arguments between us be both very loud and, yet, always, quietly loving",0
1,I thinkthis much is possible,0
1,Becausewe are more alike than different in our needs and fears,0
1,we have remainedmuch morestrangers to one anotherthanwe needto be,0

0,I wantedto like the moviebecauseI love the book,2
1,"Laura Hillenbrand's bestseller, ""Unbroken,"" is a classic",0
0,I had heard reportsthat the turning point in the book never made it to film,2
0,I attended a pre-release screening with an open mind,2
1,"Audiences are told""Unbroken"" is a ""true story.""",0
1,"It is true, as farasit goes",0
1,the story is incomplete,0
2,There have been many World War II stories told in film depicting triumphs of personal courage and survival,2
1,"The story of Louis Zamperini is one such story, but with an added dimension",0
1,"Zamperini,who died earlier this year at age 97,came home an angry man",0
1,He became addicted to alcohol and cigarettes and verbally abused his young wife as he wrestled with his inner demons,0
0,The skeleton of his story is in the film -- the plane crash at sea while on a rescue mission; the 47 days floating on a raft beforebeing picked up by a Japanese ship and thrown into a prison camp;the relentless torture and eventual liberation at the end of the war,2
0,Afterreturning to Los Angeleswe seeZamperini hugging his brother and parents,2
0,the story ends there,2
0,Director Angelina Jolie attemptsto put some flesh on the bones at the end of the film with some still shots and wordsthat tell usthat Zamperini's faith ledhim to return to Japan on a personal mission of reconciliation,2
0,"In media appearances, Jolie has refusedto discusswhythe most remarkable part of Zamperini's story was excluded from the film",2
0,That would be the nighthe was converted at the 1949 Billy Graham crusade in Los Angeles,2
5,"AsHillenbrand tells it in her book,Louis came home, poured his alcohol down the drain, threw out his cigarettes, was reconciled to his wife and became a new manbecause,he said,he had askedJesus Christ to be his savior",2
1,stories about faith have made a recent comeback on TV and in movies,0
1,attracting high ratings and large ticket sales at the box office,0
1,"it is puzzlingwhyJolie,who directed the film, and the Coen brothers,who wrote it,left out the most important part of Zamperini's story",0
1,"Onceword gets aroundthat Zamperini's conversion,which was so faithfully and beautifully chronicled in Hillenbrand's book,is not in the film,I suspect manywho shareLouis' faith will not buy tickets",0
1,Apologists for Universal Pictures saypeople can always read the rest of the story in the book,0
1,"Yes, they can, but then whyshouldthey see a filmthat highlights only half a life?",0
0,"Just beforehe died,Jolie showed Zamperini a rough cut of the film",2
5,He professedto like itand saidit doesn't force religion down people\'sthroats,2
1,That's a cliche,0
1,which doesn't really fit in this instance,0
2,"Nothing is ""forced""whenit is true",2
1,"The film, ""Selma,""which is scheduled for release on January 9,would be incompleteifit failedto depict Martin Luther King Jr  as a ministerwhose faithmotivatedhim to be a modern-day Moses",0
1,"Fortunately, in addition to Hillenbrand's book, people can read Louis\' story in his own words",0
0,"His book is titled,""Don't Give Up,Don't Give In: Lessons from an Extraordinary Life.""",2
1,The Onewho preserved his life to the endis more powerful than his Japanese prison camp abuser,0
0,"In the film ""Kings Row,"" Ronald Reagan awakensto learnthat a botched operation has resulted in the amputation of his legs",2
0,"""Where'sthe rest of me?""he asks",2
0,"Where'sthe rest of Zamperini's story is the questionI hadafter seeing ""Unbroken.""",2
1,the history of David Cameron's time as prime minister is written,0
1,no doctrine will be named after him,0
1,"The government has been ideological, but not in a waythat bears an intellectual imprint of the Conservative leader",0
1,"There have been upheavals in schools, the health service and the benefits system",0
1,"those revolutions belong to Michael Gove, Andrew Lansley and Iain Duncan Smith",0
1,Cameron gave permission,0
1,he never pioneered,0
5,"Cameron has also saidhe abhors ""isms"" and wouldn't want posterityto anoint him with one",2
5,Friends saythis makeshim a practical conservative of the old school,2
5,guided by ancientand uncodified British instincts of decency,2
1,His enemies thinkthat is a posh way ofsayinghe lacks principle,0
1,"With no pattern of belief associated with his name, Cameron's legacy will be a collection of tactical manoeuvres, with as many prominent surrenders as victories",0
1,"The true spirit of ""Cameronism"" in education, for example, is betterconveyed in the removal in 2014 of Goveto placate the teaching professionthan in his appointmentto shake up the department in the first place",0
1,But in no field is the Tory leader's trademark better defined than in his approach to Europe,0
1,Ifany political manoeuvre deservesto be named after the Conservative leader,0
1,it is the habit oftryingto sate the appetites of hardline Eurosceptics with morselsthat would always leavethem hungry,0
1,"It might be called the ""Cameron concession""",0
1,Thus has he fed the Eurosceptic pack enoughto keepit snapping at his heelsand frustrated it enoughthat his voice was drowned by angry barking,0
1,Perhaps the saddest aspect of this spectacle isthat it saw a potentially sound policy trampled in the melee,0
1,The outline of Cameron's position isthat Britain should stay in the EU but under changed terms,0
1,They will change anyway,0
1,becausethe priority for most other member states is bolstering the single currency,0
1,This involves the integration of a euro-core with serious implications for Britain's status one way or another,0
1,"So the principle of pro- active renegotiation, ratified by referendum, is sound",0
1,But Cameron spoiled a plausible position with cowardice,0
1,he set his renegotiation up as an empty vessel intowhich hardliners poured Ukip-ish fantasies ofending immigration,0
1,He boughtthe argumentthat says the terms on offer from Brusselsget betterthe closerBritain gets to the exit,0
1,althoughthat logic is commonly advanced by peoplewho wantthe negotiations to fail,0
1,"The deadline for his referendum, the end of 2017, was plucked from thin air without regard forwhatwas diplomatically feasible or economically wise",0
1,But the chief reason Cameron's EU policy hasn't workedforhim isthat voters also consider motivewhenawarding merit,0
1,Thosewho want a referendumin orderto leave the EU mistrust the prime ministerbecausehe wants a different outcome,0
1,pro-Europeans don't trustCameron to defend Britain's interests in Europe because the whole policycame about as a sop to the sceptics,0
1,That doesn't leave many peoplewho thinkthe Tories have the right policy for the right reason,0
1,Europe exemplifies the problem,0
1,it runs deeper,0
1,"Cameron's team are surethey are running on an admirable record: economic growth, rising employment, lower crime, a reduced deficit and reformed welfare",0
1,"These are things, like the EU referendum,that should makethe Tories popular",0
1,"By the same calculation, Labour, lacking those credentials, should be out of the running",0
1,the campaign has startedandEd Miliband is still ahead,0
1,"Downing Street clings to the now familiar explanationthat voters haven't properly engaged with the choice,andthat the Tory surge will come at the eleventh hourwhenthe reality of a possible Miliband regime penetrates the national consciousness",0
1,whatifCameron has hitthe limit of credit available for five years in chargebecauseeven the good bits don't connect in people's minds with decent motives?,0
1,That iswhatLabour strategists are banking on,0
1,"Miliband's personal ratings are bleak, except on measures of decency and empathy",0
1,So those are the leadership qualitieshis campaign aimsto project,0
1,The contrastthey wantto drawis between Cameron's ethical plasticity and a challengerwho sticks to his beliefs,0
1,"Miliband will be cast as a man guided bywhatDavid Axelrod, Barack Obama's former aide now advising Labour, calls""a north star"" - a compass pointthat tells votersa leader is propelled by somethingmore noble than the salvation of his own skin",0
1,Wavererswho don't warm to Miliband(andwho aren't irredeemably riddled with anti-Westminster rage)might still be persuadedthat he is in politics for the right reason,0
1,The opposite is true of Cameron,0
1,Even those in his own partywho like the direction of policycannot sincerely claimthat their leader is driven by much beyond a sense of entitlement to the job,0
1,That was less of an impediment in the past,0
1,"For much of the 20th century, Britain was ruled by Conservativeswho thought of political theory as something suspect or vulgar,a folly for continentals and socialists, and no substitute for the innate good sense drilled into English boys at the best schools",0
1,"The Thatcher revolution disrupted the patrician culture in the Conservative party, but not the underlying beliefthat Tory rule is a default setting for British politics; the normto which the country tends",0
1,"That assumption, more than economic growth, deficit reduction, an EU referendum or any other part of the prospectus, iswhatmakesCameron thinkhe can stay on after May",0
1,It is the confidencethat he is an archetypal prime minister and the only credible candidate for the job,0
1,Perhaps he will be proved right,0
1,He will havemoney and much of the press to amplify that view,0
1,But even loyal Conservatives can't entirely ignore the intellectual void at the centre,0
1,The right has decried it as often as the left,0
1,"The past five years have posed huge challenges for Britain regarding the economy, our place in Europe, England's relations with Scotland, the decline of trust in institutions",0
1,of which encounter with a great problem can itbe saidthe prime minister truly rose to the occasion?,0
1,Cameron doesn't have big answers,0
1,he shrinks questions,0
1,"that ishowhistory will remember him,whatever happens in May",0
1,He successfully pursued power and spent it without purpose,0
2,New Year's resolutions often lose their power so quickly and completelythat they have become cliche,2
1,"But there are real,easily achievedways to positively impact your life beginning January 1",0

1,India projects itself as a target of Islamic terrorism perpetrated by home- grown Indian Mujahideen (IM) or Pakistan-based outfits particularly in India- administered Kashmir,0
1,essentially to garner sympathy internationally and unite the population,0
1,"The truth, however, isthat many armed groups like the Maoist uprising in the ""Red Corridor"" and the secessionist rebellion in the north-east pose a graver challenge to the Indian state than bombings and sporadic terrorist strikes",0
1,which New Delhi toutsto validate its vulnerability-cum-victimhood narrative before the world,0
4,The latest Global Terrorism Index released by international think tank Institute of Economics and Peace revealsthat whilejihadists were responsible for 15 percent of terrorism-related killings in India;Maoists accounted for the lion's share of casualties - a whopping 50 percent - in 2013,2
4,"The remaining 35 percent of deaths were caused by guerillas fighting for statehood or independence in states like Assam, Manipur and Nagaland",2
1,"Armed group, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB),which gunned down 75 Adivasis, or tribespeople, just before Christmas in its diabolical pursuit of a separate homeland for ethnic Bodos in Assam,was on the government's radar for a long time",0
1,The carnage provoked an uncompromising crackdown by the Indian army but thereby hangs a grim tale of political expediency,0
1,"Syed Asif Ibrahim, Intelligence Bureau director, seemedto have a premonition of the massacre",0
5,"He pointed outthat NDFB has become one of the deadliest separatist outfits in business at the IB's 49th annual conference in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Interior Minister Rajnath Singh in Assam's largest city, Guwahati, last month",2
5,He observedthat one option before the government wasto bring NDFB to the negotiating table,2

1,The BJP immediately let loose the army on NDFBto repay a big debt of gratitude and regainAdivasi goodwill crucial forwresting Assam from the Congress Party in the 2016 state assembly elections,0
0,"Adivasis,who account for almost 20 percent of Assam's voters,ditched the Congress Party in this year's parliamentary elections and supportedthe BJP giving the party seven seats compared to four in 2009",2
0,"The party's Adivasi candidates, Rameshwar Teli and Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, trounced Congress MPs in Dibrugarh and Jorhat",2
4,The BJP's vote-share rose to 36.6 percent from 16.21 percent thanks to Adivasis ,2
1,which also explains the BJP's muscular response to the December 23 massacre,0
1,In a sense Bodos were tempting fate for a long time,0
4,They constitute barely six percent of Assam's 33 million population but want half of the state for themselves,2
1,"They chose the path of terror way back in 1987 with the slogan ""Divide Assam 50-50"" leaving behind a trail of murder and mayhem",0
0,"The first tripartite peace treaty between the federal government, state government and Bodos was signed in 1993",2
1,it collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions,0
0,Another accord signed in 2003 resulted in the Bodo Territorial Autonomous District (BTAD)giving them considerable autonomy,2
1,"BTAD covering around 8,795 square-km area was given to Bodos on a platter",0
4,althoughthey comprised only 20 percent of the population in BTAD,2
4,The rest are predominantly Muslims -many of whom are migrants from Bangladesh- and Adivasis,2
0,Bodos floateda political party called Bodoland People's Front (BPF)to administer BTAD,2
1,"armed groups, such as Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) and NDFB with their extremist-supremacist agenda, called the shots",0
1,It was a bizarre case of 20 percent ruling over 80 percent!,0

0,"On Monday afternoon, Senator Dianne Feinstein released a letter to Barack Obama,suggestinga series of reforms ""to make surethat the United States never again engages in actionsthat you have acknowledgedwere torture""",2
0,A monthafterher office released the landmark (but still heavily redacted)Senate torture report,2
0,Feinstein is now calling for legislationto strengthen the prohibition against torture,2
1,This is a laudable and necessary step,0
2,torture has been a felony for decades,2
2,"So have war crimes, lying to Congress and obstruction of justice",2
1,The fundamental problem isthat the US government has been unable or unwillingto enforce those laws against the CIA,0
1,"reform does not confront the reasons for that failure,it may not deter the United States fromengaging in torture under a future president",0
1,To the extentthat federal prosecutors have simply lacked the political willto investigate the CIA,0
1,there's not muchCongress can do about it,0
1,"But legislation could address many of the other factorsthat allowedthe CIA to torture prisoners, destroy evidence and lie to investigators with impunity",0
1,"There is the CIA's reliance on secret ""torture memos"" written by the Office of Legal Counsel ",0
1,which exploited some weaknesses in the legal definition of torture,0
1,but depended far more heavily on absurd legal arguments and false representations of fact by the CIA,0
1,There's the unethical role of CIA doctors and psychologists in monitoring interrogations,0
1,"And above all, there remainsthe CIA's abilityto keep all the evidence of its crimesclassified",0
5,"The only explanation the justice department has ever provided for the failureto indict a single CIA officer for torture, war crimes, homicide, destruction of evidence or any of the other crimesthe Senate report documents is a bland statementthat ""the admissible evidence would not be sufficientto obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt""",2
0,"The justice department refusesto answer questions about the role played by top-secret classification in that decision, or disclose any of the records from the criminal investigations",2
1,"But we doknowthat untilthe Senate report was released,the Obama administration took the positionthat every detail of an individual detainee's torture in CIA custody was top secret- including former CIA prisoners' memories of their own treatment, the locations of black sites and the names of all the witnesses",0
1,"We know the CIA redacted from the report not only the names but even the pseudonyms of nearly every CIA officer and contractor involved in the program, and every countrythat hosted a black site",0
1,And we knowthat every last civil suit brought by CIA torturevictims has been dismissed on national security grounds,0
1,So it's difficultto imaginehowa prosecutor could have made a torture case against the CIA withoutdisclosing this evidence-and even harderto imagine the agency allowing its release,0
1,"In theory, Obama's December 2009 executive order on national security classification should prevent the CIA fromusing secrecyto place itself beyond the rule of law",0
5,"sincethe order specifically forbids classifying informationto ""conceal violations of law""",2
1,"In practice, though, the prohibition is virtually never enforced",0
1,"The Obama administration - like the Bush administration before it - takes the positionthat the CIA's criminal actions can be legitimately classifiedifthey are ""intelligence sources and methods""",0
1,"And neither Congress, nor the president, nor the courts have imposed any legal limit onwhatcounts as an intelligence source or method",0
1,"In practice, the phrase has cometo mean ""anythingthe intelligence community doesn't wantyou to know.""",0
1,"Congress needsto write a legal definition of ""intelligence sources and methods""that imposes real limits, and makes clearthat it excludes torture and other crimes",0
1,"Feinstein and her staff deserve tremendous credit forfinally breaking through the wall of secrecythat the CIA built around its torture program, in the face of fierce opposition from the agency and the White House",0
0,"But their investigation did not beginuntil afterthe black-site program had already ended, in large part because of leaks to the press",2
1,"Despite staffers' scrupulous protection of classified information, the CIA subjected them to unlawful surveillance, triedto havethem prosecutedand is still tryingto retaliate",0
1,the report is still full of unjustified redactions,0
1,the Department of Justice refusesto either reopen its criminal investigations into torture or explainwhythey were closed in the first place,0
1,torture is a crime - but so is revealing evidence of torturethat the CIA wants hidden,0
1,And it's only the second crimethat getsyou prosecuted,0
1,"Yes, let'sstrengthen the laws against torture",0

0,December 9 marks the six-month anniversary of ISIL's capture of Mosul,2
1,The capture both put ISIL on the map and simultaneously threatenedto fundamentally redraw it,0
1,"Coverage of the low level civil war in Iraq had long disappeared off the front pages with a war weary western public happyto be ""out"" of a complex conflictthat seemedto have no end",0
1,The boldness of ISIL's sweep through the region and the taking of Mosul was the triggerthat sparked a new focus on Iraq and put US warplanes back in the sky,0
1,the city itself was quickly forgotten,0
1,"Today, Mosul is a city on death row enduring both a terrible present and the potential of a worse future",0
1,Initial ideas of a swift retaking of the city were dispelled by the ousting of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the emergence of US President Barack Obama's anti-ISIL coalition,0
1,ISIL has provedto be a resilient opponent,0
1,its march forward has been held up in Kobane,0
0,Mosul remains under the black flag,2
5,"In November, Deputy Governor of Mosul Nuraddin Kaplan saidthat ""the sooner the operation begins the better.The more timethat passes,the harder it will become""",2
1,Movesto retake Mosulare in the pipeline,0
1,I would arguethat the priority should be given to the strategy ofprompting a collapse from within as opposed to a destructive attemptto take it by force,0
1,"ISIL's predecessors, ""al-Qaeda in Iraq"", struggledto turn fromcapturing large urban areas togoverning them",0
1,reports out of Mosul would suggesta similar trend is at play,0
1,What information there isthat managesto come outpaints a bleak picture under ISIL rule,0
5,"In October, the Guardian reported ""severe shortages of food and water, no functioning public institutions, and the local economy in a state of near collapse""",2
0,"The school system has been ""ISIL-ed"" with an education tax imposed,genders segregatedandsubjects such as art banned",2
5,"Christian homes and Shia shrines have reportedly been looted and displaced residents of Mosultestified to Al-Monitorthat ISIL had arrested up to 25,000 people between June and October",2
1,"We've also learnt the ISIL-style of city governance elsewhere and in particular in Raqqa, their nominal capital",0
0,"An incredibly brave piece of citizen journalism shot by a resident in a hijab showeda city dominated by young, bearded men with guns on every street cornerimposing both their ideas of urban management and social control",2
1,Prayer and conservative appearance is strictly enforced,0
1,"executions, even crucifixions, are commonplace",0
1,There is a bitter ironythat residents of Raqqa have swapped one police state for another,0
1,A smart strategy would seekto win Mosul from within,0
1,ISIL's abilityto attract disillusioned Iraqi Sunnisis being met by new Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi's far more inclusive vision for the country,0
1,Appointing a defence minister from Mosul and finally agreeing on an oil sharing agreement with the Kurdsis evidence of this work in progress from the new premier,0
1,Abbadi's appeal to Iraqi nationalism and sensitivity to tribal and sectarian dynamics must be ableto offer a bigger pull than the ISIL offer of a dysfunctional caliphate,0
5,"Residents of ISIL-controlled Raqqa have spoken offeeling like ""strangers in their own city""",2
1,Effective propaganda can help split Iraqi members of ISIL from their often foreign leadership,0
1,This won't be easy,0
5,"reports have suggestedthat ISIL has decidedto shut down most mobile telecommunications inside the city, perhaps conscious of the needto protect their battle for hearts and minds",2
1,The alternative is far more dangerous for the city,0
5,US intelligence estimatesthat ISIL has the weaponsto fight for two years,2
1,"A rejuvenated Iraqi armythat has put competency, sectarian and ""ghost soldiers"" issuesaside is estimatedto needsome 80,000 troops to ""take"" the city",0
1,"Supposedly accurate US weapons destroyed a large part of Fallujahin orderto ""win it"" back in 2004",0
1,"With this in mind, there is a high chanceMosul would be hit even harder",0
1,leaving a trail of rubble and refugees strewn across the north of the country,0
1,"The fate of Syria's second city, Aleppo, must serve as a warning as to the future of Iraq's second city, Mosul",0
1,"An effective and joined up political and military strategy led by Iraq's new government must makethe residents of Mosul hate the caliphate and, at tremendous risk to themselves, take on ISIL from within rather than allow their cityto become yet another Middle East urban graveyard",0
1,Mosul is a city of immense history but currently stares at the fate ofbecominghistory itself,0
1,"Perhaps the most unexpected result of the Russian-Ukrainian war - at least for its instigators -- is the increasing support of Ukrainian citizens for all the thingsthat the war was designedto destroy, revert, or undermine",0
1,"Despite the challenges of war, the economic crisis and political difficulties, Ukrainians are committedto endure in the face of Russian aggression and pursue the dreams of a democratic and stable Ukrainethat the Maidan protests inspired",0
1,This is their opportunityto undo the oligarchic kleptocracythey were living inand build a statethat enshrines the rule of law and egalitarianism,0
4,"Just within half a year, from April to November, the popular support for Ukraine's EU membership grew from 55 to 64 percent",2
4,their propensity for the Moscow-led Customs Union declined from 24 percent to 17,2
4,"Support for Ukraine's membership in NATOthat had been traditionally very low (around 15 percent) since the 1999 NATO bombardment of Yugoslavia and the US illegal invasion of Iraq,has reached 51 percent, with 24 percent still undecided",2
4,Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity in Ukraine plummeted from solid the 60-70 percent in the past years to single digits,2
4,"Support for a ""common state"" with Russia declined from the impressive 15-20 percent in the past to 5 percent",2
4,insistence onestablishingclosed borders and a visa regime with Russia quadrupled - from 11 to 45 percent,2
4," despite the Kremlin's incredible investments in propaganda, only 5 percent of Ukrainian respondents saythey trust Russian media",2
4,Ukrainian media are trusted by some 67 percent,2
4,"Within the year, the number of self-defined ""patriots of Ukraine"" increased from 81 to 86 percent, and the support for national independence consolidated from 61 to 76 percent",2
4,opposition to it declined from 28 per cent to 12,2
1,The worst news for Putin might bethat both the Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking populations are committed to independence,0
1,albeitunequally,0
4,"Some 91 percent of Ukrainian speakers, 71 percent of bilinguals and 45 percent of Russian speakers support the country's independence",2
4,30 percent of the latter do not support it,2
1,"Another, perhaps even more unexpected result of the war is the persistent optimism of many Ukrainians, despite the daily war casualties in Donbas, the disruption of electricity in many regions outside the capital Kiev, the devaluation of the Ukrainian currency, the 20 percent inflation, the 7 percent economic decline and the prospect of further economic contraction at about 4 percent next year",0
4,"All gloomy facts notwithstanding,the number of self- professedoptimists increased in a year from 12 to 24 percent",2
4,the number of thosewho look forward with hopegrew from 38 to 51 percent,2
4,the number of thosewho feel hopelessfell down from 16 percent to 8,2
1,The government still is trusted by the majority of the people,0
4,"In November, 52 percent expressed their confidence in the prime minister, and 49 percent in the president - both higherthanthe rating President Barack Obama has in the US",2
0,A survey asked Ukrainians shortly before the October parliamentary electionswhat kind of MPsthey would liketo see in the next Parliament,2
4,"81 percent of the respondents chose from the broad list of hypothetic MPs first of all ""thosewho are realistic and open about Ukraine's economyand readyto implement radical, sometimes painfulreforms""",2
1,It is clearthat the conflict in Donbas has encouraged Ukrainians' readinessto accept difficult but much-needed reforms,0
1,The comfort of low gas prices and Russia's overwhelming political and economic presence in the country tamed the urge for reform for years,0
1,Russian military aggression has rekindled it,0
1,The list of the urgent reforms is extensive and includes virtually all public spheres,0
1,"Three of them are particularly essential: economy (with the energy sector having the highest priority), justice, and defence",0
1,"So far, Ukraine had allegedly benefitted from the artificially low prices in the energy trade with Russia",0
1,"It seems, increasingly,that that kind of trade was beneficial primarily,ifnot exclusively,for the narrow circle of people on both sides of the pipeline",0
1,"Multiple and arbitrarily definedprices provided them with an excellent opportunity for double book-keeping, smuggling, resale, and many more murky business transactionsthat created dozens of billionaires, not only in energy-rich Russia but also in energy-poor Ukraine",0
1,Not a single government in the past daredto kill the chickenthat was laying golden eggs,0
1,"None of them ever exposed the national ""Naftogaz"" company to an international audit",0
1,Nobody - either on the Ukrainian side or the Russian - submitted their bitterly disputed cases to the international arbitrage,0
1,which apparently required the disclosure of all books,0
1,One may saythat the energy sector reform is a litmus test for any Ukrainian government,0
1,"No other reforms would be possible without eradication of this major source of corruption, shadowy business and clientelism",0
1,"All other reforms - like economic transparency, deregulation, decentralisation, reform of the court system and the law-enforcement agencies - largely depend on the success of this one",0
1,the window of opportunity is still openandthe government still has a chanceto pull the country out of the post-Soviet morass,0
1,"Ukrainians have invested much hope in national independence, in the Orange revolution, and in the Euromaidan",0
1,"Not all of them, of course, but certainly the most active, entrepreneurial, future-oriented part of societythat grew up,within the past two decades, in both its size and civic maturity",0
1,They will not stop their westward drive and their pressure on any governmentto meet the demands of Maidan,0
1,"It becomes increasingly clearthat Moscow's primary goal is noto occupy Ukraine, but to destabilise it and preclude real and lasting reforms",0
1,"Moscow wants Kiev back to normal: fully emasculated, obedient and subservient,embracing the ""Eurasian"" way of development- of crony capitalism, authoritarian arbitrariness, lawlessness, and rabid anti-westernism",0
1,"Successful, European Ukraine will be a deadly blow to Putinism as an embodiment of that broadly advertised anti-European alternative",0
1,"This iswhythe Kremlin has never spared effortsto promote the idea of Ukraine as a ""failed state"", arguably ""artificial""and incapable of independent development without external (naturally Russian) supervision",0
1,the covert means do not work-asthey did after the Orange revolution,0
1,- the overt military invasion is put into action,0
1,"However formidable and subversive Russia's strategy is,the real makers of Ukraine's either success or failure are still at home",0
1,It is up to Ukrainiansto complete their unfinished post-1989 revolution,0
1,They are suffering severely forlagging behind other Eastern European states,0
1,Putin's Russia is certainly not Gorbachev's or Yeltsin's,0
1,Ukraine is not the same either,0
1,"Today it has the opportunity, the will and the potentialto transform into a stable and transparent democracy",0
1,"Sixty-six years ago was the high water mark of global disapproval of xenophobia, and racial and religious discrimination",0
0,"On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and then gave Eleanor Roosevelt a standing ovation for her leading role",2
1,"Today, this statement of principle would never pass",0
1,Racial and religious discrimination is the trademark of the U.N  itself,0
3,look back at the year 2014,1
4,"At least another 75,000 people were butchered in Syria",2
0,"There were violent crackdowns in Hong Kong, bloody takeovers in Ukraine, subjugation of women in Saudi Arabia, brutal lawlessness in Yemen, Libya, Nigeria, Mexico - and so on",2
0,"But at the United Nations, 2014 wraps up with the adoption of twenty times more resolutions by the General Assembly condemning the state of Israel forviolating human rights than any other nation on earth",2
1,There is not one General Assembly resolution worried about human rights in China or Russia or Saudi Arabia or Yemen or Libya or Nigeria or Mexico - and so forth,0
1,The General Assembly will even adoptone resolution critical of Syria but two resolutionsdemandingIsrael immediately return the Golan Heights to Syria - the placewherelucky Syrians and UN peacekeepers dash to Israel for protection,0
1,"The demonization of Israel, and the inequality of the self- determination of the Jewish people, by way of the United Nations have one painfully obvious purpose: the end of the Jewish state",0
1,Eleanor Roosevelt would have calledit a gross violation of the very spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,0
1,"you walk into the newly-renovated UN,which opened its doors in the fall after a $2 billion dollar spending spree (a quarter ofwhich came from American taxpayers)",0
0,the first stop on the public tour straight off the elevator is an exhibit on Palestinian rights,2

1,Whose telling the truth?,0
1,It's not like Hollywood typeslikeSony are adversaries of President Obama,0
1,they're telling two different stories right now,0
5,"On Friday during this show, the president saidhe wishedSony execs had reached out to himto discuss the cyber-attack or vandalism,ashe calls it,beforethey decidedto pull the moviethe interview from theaters",2
5,But just a few hours later ...the Sony CEO saidin fact he had contacted Senior White House officialsto discuss what the governmentthoughthey should do,2
1,which one is it?,0
1,Could it bethat any senior white house advisor would not have relayed the message to the presidentthat they'd heard from Sony?,0
0,We were reporting all last weekthat the president was receiving daily updates and holding daily meetings about the North Korea cyber crisis,2
1,Seems implausiblethat could have slipped through the cracks,0
5,So now the president sayshe'll weigh the options presented to him aboutwhatto do about North Korea,2

0,Jeb Bush announced Tuesday morningthat he has set up an exploratory committeeto pursuerunning for president,2
1,Virtually every personwho takesthis step ultimately throws his or her hat in the ring,0
1,It's only a matter of time,0
4,Polls show him at or near the top of the prospective Republican nominees for 2016,2
4,The recent McClatchy-Marist poll has Mitt Romney and Bush leading with 19 and 15 percent respectively,2
4,"And a PPP poll has Bush ahead of Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Paul Ryan and both Rand Paul and Ted Cruz",2
1,"Despite this, Bush by no means has an insurmountable lead",0
1,"the Bush name for some is a positive and will help Jeb enormously,",0
1,"for others it is an unalterable negative both because of prior history, ideology and perceived performance in office",0
1,"there is one constituencythat I fully expectto support Jeb Bush: the donors, bundlers and thosewho pursue independent expenditure",0
1,There's every reasonto believethat this community - the money community - will rally behind Bush's candidacy,0
1,"given the importance of independent expenditure political action committees in the last presidential election, it's fairto assume that between his own campaign committee and outsiders,he will be the best funded candidate in the Republican field",0
1, it will be far from a cakewalk for Bush in the primary,0
1,His problems are three fold,0
1, his ardent support for Common Core does not sit well with many in his party,0
1," he has come out in support of comprehensive immigration reform, a hot button issue today with the GOP and its supporters, especially in light of President Obama's executive action last month",0
1,"And third, he's considered tax increases as part of an overall reform packageto help balance the budget in the past - anathema to thosethat control the GOP today",0
1,"For all these reasons, it may be hard for Tea Party Republicans and the right wing of the party more generally,to support his candidacy",0
1,This is notto saythat Jeb Bush will not be smart enoughto tryto neutralize these potential disadvantages,0
1,He surely will,0
1,"To this end, Bush's thoughtful and reasonable message at the Wall Street CEOs conference was a positive and uplifting one",0
1,exactly whatthe Republican Party needsto go mainstream,0
1,whatthe Tea Party itself abhors,0
1,"Should Bush make the general electionhe will be a compelling candidate against the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton",0
1,The most recent poll numbers show the race betweenthem tightening,0
1,I suspect the campaignitself will reflect that reality,0
1,both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton represent the center of their parties,0
1,both are practical politicians,0
1,ifnothing else,0
1,They're both also smart and serious about the issues,0
1,"we can expect,ifthey're the nominees,to have a thoughtful debate about America's future with the possibility of candidate agreement on a number of issues, somethingwe haven't seen in decades",0
1,I know Jeb Bush,0
1,I know Hillary Clinton,0
1,"They are both considerate people, committed to the broader interests of the American people regardless of political party",0
1,Jeb Bush's entry into the race prospectively gives the Republicans their strongest candidate and possible nominee,0

1,Peoplewhose liveshave been broken,0
1,whose humanitywas forgotten under this state-sanctioned programme,0
1,The case of Abu Zubaydah has long been known,0
0,Amnesty International first raised its concerns with the US government in April 2002,2
0,He was the first personto be taken into CIA custody considered by the agencyto have high intelligence value,2
1,Abu Zubaydah was effectively treated as a human guinea pigto test the CIA's emerging interrogation regime,0
0,"He was subjected to a range of torture methods, includingbeing waterboarded multiple times",2
1,The SSCI summary adds some new chilling details,0
5,"A July 15, 2002 cable sent by the interrogation team at ""Detention Site Green"", believedto be in Thailand,ended:""In light of the planned psychological pressure techniques to be implemented,we needto get reasonable assurancesthat [Abu Zubaydah] will remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life.""",2

1,Reports were constantly fed back to top authorities,0
5,"Daily cables sent from ""Detention Site Green"" to CIA headquarters recordedthat Abu Zubaydah frequently ""cried"", ""begged"", ""pleaded"", and ""whimpered""",2
5,"At times, he was ""hysterical"" and ""distressed to the levelthat he was unableto effectively communicate""",2
5,"Waterboarding sessions would result in ""hysterical pleas""",2

1,The injustice continues,0

5,"Amnesty International believesthis should be done sooner ratherthanlater, indeed should be set in motionnow",2
1,The Senate committee also needsto address the factthat the US human rights violations and crimes went beyond torture,0
0,The CIA detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance ,2
1,"which, like torture, is a crime under international law",0
1,No one has been brought to justice for these crimes,0
1,This accountability gap leaves the US squarely on the wrong side of its international obligations,0
1,"Those responsible, no matter their current or previous level of office, must be brought to justice, along with those in other countriesthat colluded with the CIAto facilitate these programmes",0
1,December 10 marked 30 years since the adoption of the Convention Against Torture - an anniversarywhich the US would do well notto gloss over,0

1,the apparent quiet does not signify consent,0
1,A look at history showswhy,0
0,The US has been attacked on domestic territory twice in the past century,2
0,"On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbour",2
0,"killing 2,403 Americans and wounding 1,178 others",2
0,"The next day, US Congress votedto declare war on Japan",2
0,thus committing to active hostilities in World War II,2
2,That declaration of war has since provedto be the last in the history of the US,2
0,"The next and last mass scale violent attack by an outside aggressor on the domestic territory of the US occurred 13 years ago, on September 11, 2001, with the immediate death toll approaching 3,000",2
0,"Three days later, Congress adopted an Authorisation for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against those held responsible for the September 11 attacks",2
0,"Inso doing,Congress delegated war-making powers to President George W Bush under the terms of the War Powers Act of 1973",2
1,December 7 and September 11 are notable in partbecausein both cases horrendous violence against the people of the US was respondedtowith an act of Congress,0
1,"Oppose or support US entry into either of those wars, question or affirmthat those wars were lawful,there was no question in either casethat Congress had signed off on them",0
1,It matteredthat Congress approve,0
2,"becauseArticle I, Section 8 of the US Constitution accords primary war powers, including the powerto commence and end war,to Congress alone",2
1,For a president of the USto make war without congressional approvalwas an unthinkable actthat would have threatened the legitimacy of the federal government,0
1,"With his war on the so-called Islamic State,US President Barack Obama has committed that unthinkable act",0
1,Congress has let him,0
1," by all appearances, no one outside of a handful of members of Congress, legal scholars, and peace activists has spoken out in protest",0
3,Contrast this moment with that of the weeks and months following September 11,1
0,"On September 29, 2001, upwards of 25,000 people marched through Washington, DC, against the impending invasion of Afghanistan",2
0,tens of thousands demonstrated elsewhere throughout the US,2
4,"By April 20, 2002, the anti-war protest in Washington drew over 150,000",2
4,"By February 15, national protest turnout hit 2 million",2
1,"Given this history, one cannot concludethat the size and volume of anti-war protests directly resulted from the relative popularity of a particular war",0
0, the 2001-2003 protests erupted and swelled over a periodin which polls showed continued strong support among the US publicfor Washington's war operations,2
0,"And in fact, as in 2003-2008 public opinion turned against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the size and volume of anti-war movement went down",2
1,"The simple and correct explanation for this history isthat anti-war organisers made decisions in 2001, 2002, and 2003,to focus their energies onmobilising street protests",0
1,"andthat in the years 2004-2008,asanti-war sentiment was taken up by a majority of the American people,many anti-war organisers shifted much of their focusto electing anti-war candidates to office",0
1,Whathas changedsinceObama assumed the presidency?,0
1,"In Washington, in terms of war and security, very little",0
0,Guantanamo remains in operation,2
1,The police state has expanded,0
1,Assassination and missile strikes have increased,0
1,Border militarisation and deportations have escalated,0
1,And US military operations have continued and spread further across the globe,0
1,"Having lived and struggled through this history,whywould anti-warorganisers chooseto respond to Washington's undeclared, unauthorised war against the so-called Islamic State by mobilising street protests?",0
1,Whywould they mobiliseto elect anti-war candidates?,0
1,The core of the peace movement remains active in many parts of the US,0
0,"Every day I receive notices about civil disobedience at military bases, hunger strikes, local government resolutions calling for a shift in spending priorities away from the military, and much more",2
1,"For this reason, the relative silence of anti-war organisers in the face of the war against the so-called Islamic State stands out as a warning to the Washington establishment; thosewho opposetheir policies questionwhetherCongress and the presidency can provide effective redress for the grievances of the American people",0
1,Washington should fear the silence of the US anti-war movement,0
1,forit is full of sound and fury and signifies everything,0
5,"A new Pew Research Center survey findsthat, for the first time in their surveys, the majority of Americans oppose more gun control",2
4,Gallup and CNN polls tell a similar story,2
1,Opposition to gun control has been increasing over at least the last couple of decades,0
4,Gun control groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollarsto tryto convince Americansthat gun control is the answer,2
4,"In 2013, gun owners' groups -- including the NRA -- spent less than one seventh as much on television advertisements",2

1,",that gun is far more likelyto prevent murderthanit isto be used in an accidental shooting or to kill a loved one",0
1,Accidental gun deaths get a lot of press coverage,0
1,the press is quite misleadingwhenit talks about juvenile gun deaths,0
1, many news reports lump in young deaths involving gang fights,0
2,These deaths are also tragic,2
1,they have nothingto do withwhetherlaw-abiding citizens should own guns,0
4,"The Centers for Disease Control reportsthat, in 2012, there were 58 accidental gun deaths involving children under the age of 15",2
4,More than 20 times as many children died dueto accidental suffocation,2
4,"In most cases,an adult accidentally shoots a child,notchildren shooting themselves or other children",2
1,And many of those adults have criminal records and drug or alcohol problems,0
4,"Between 2000 and 2014, the number of concealed handgun permits soared from about 2.7 million to well over 12 million",2

4,"The Pew Research Center survey foundthat 57 percent of Americans believegun ownership ""protects people frombecoming victims of crime.""",2
4,"Thirty-eight percent believethat it ""puts people's safety at risk.""",2
4,"Support for gun ownership has grown particularly sharply among blacks and women, with their support since 2012 rising by 25 and 11 percentage points respectively",2
1,"My research showsthat sinceblacks are the most likely victims of violent crime,they are also the oneswho benefit most frombeing ableto defend themselves",0
1,Women and the elderly are especially unlikelyto be ableto fend off a male attacker without the benefit of a firearm,0
1,"Gary Kleck, Larry Southwick and other academics have shownthat having a gunis by far the safest optionwhenconfronted by a criminal",0
1,Police are extremely important inreducing crime,0
1, I have foundthat they are by far the single most important factor,0
1,But police knowthat they almost always arrive on the crime sceneaftera crime has occurred,0
1,becauseof that police are among the strongest supporters for private gun ownership,0
4,"PoliceOne,which has a membership of about 450,000 active and retired police officers,found last yearthat 76 percent of its members believelegally armed citizens are either extremely or very important tostopping crime",2
4,"Over 91 percent of members ""support the concealed carry of firearms by civilianswho have not been convicted of a felonyand/or not been deemedpsychologically/medically incapable.""",2
1,This is a less stringent standardthanexists in most right-to-carry states,0
0,"In the wake of tragedies such as Newtown, gun control advocates keeppushing for more restrictions",2
1,But the proposed regulations have nothingto do with the tragedies,0
5,"Even Mark Glaze,who was executive director of Bloomberg's Everytown For Gun Safety until earlier this year,conceded to the Wall Street Journal,""Is ita messaging problemwhena mass shooting happensand nothingthat we haveto offerwould have stopped that mass shooting?Sure it's a challenge....""",2
1,"Evenworse for gun control advocates,people are realizingthat regulations -- such as gun-free zones -- tendto encourage attacks bydisarming law-abiding citizens instead of criminals",0
1,"Hopefully, cities such as Washington, Los Angeles and New York will change their rulesasmore poor blacks and women recognize the benefits of gun ownership",0
1,"At present, only rich, well-connected people can get concealed carry permits in those places",0
1,The poor have every bit as much rightto defend themselves,0
1,Increased gun ownership may solve another problem,0
1,There are two waysto protect poor law-abiding blacks in high-crime urban areas,0
1,Either rely more on the police or makeit easier for peopleto defend themselves,0

1,He has charm and a certain decency,0
1,he is too easily blown off course by adverse winds arising within his own party and outside it,0
1,"This has ledhim to take positions on Europe and immigrationthat could have been expressly designedto reduce our influence on our neighbours, onesthat could lead to Britain departing the European Union",0

1,Mrs Merkel is the strongest and most important leader in Europe,0
1,She is hardly beyond reproach,0
1,"The contradiction in her position isthat at home she essentially governs as a social democrat,yetshe operates as a neoliberal hawk abroad",0
1,"Her austerity drive can be said, at the very least,to be causing as many problemsasit solves",0

1,But today one surely hasto askhow much of that was just sharp PR,0
1, the tricky underlying economics of healthcare in the region were not transformed-as the financial woes of nearby Peterborough and Stamford NHS foundation trust illustrate,0
1,"And now, out of the blue - in a manner reminiscent of G4S's eve-of-Olympics confessionthat it was not goingto do the full securitythat it had signed up for- the private contractor at Hinchingbrooke has admittedthat it is losing its appetite for the job",0
1,The same spinthat previously flattered the companyis now directed without mercy against the politicians instead,0
1,"The company's statement highlights not only the developing A&E; crisis, but also the ""inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regime"" in the post-Lansley landscape, as well the gulf between NHS and social care servicesthat Labour's Andy Burnham has made a particular line of attack on the coalition",0

5,"Os Guinness, the author of more than a dozen books defending traditional Judeo-Christian values and Jeffersonian personal liberty, arguedthat we should embrace individual liberty and personal dignity and reject the ""no givens, no rules, no limits"" governmentwe now have",2
5,He went onto opinethat the government today is not the constitutionally restrained protector of personal freedomsthe Framers left us,2
5,but rather has become the wealth-distributing protector of collective intereststhe Founding Fathers never could have imagined,2
1,Yet the problem is a deep one,0
2,The Framers believed in the presumption of liberty,2
2,"which declaresthat we are freeto make personal choices,andthe government cannot interfere with our libertiesunlesswe violate the rights of others",2
1,the federal government cannot interfere with our personal choices bywriting any lawit wants,0
1,it can only regulate behavior or spend moneywhenthe Constitution authorizesit to do so,0
1,"But for the past 100 years, the federal government has rejected the Madisonian conceptthat it is limited to the 16 discrete powers the Constitution delegates to it,and has claimedits powers are unlimited, subject only to the express prohibitions in the Constitution",0
1,Even those prohibitions can be gotten around,0
1,"sincegovernment lawyers have persuadedfederal courts to rulethat Congress can spend tax dollars or borrowed moneyon any projectsit wishes,whetherauthorized by the Constitutionor not",0
1,The courts even have authorizedCongress to use federal tax dollarsto bribe the states intoenacting lawsthat Congress is powerlessto enact,0
1,Congress has done so,0
2,The Declaration of Independence defines our personal liberties as inalienable aspects of our humanity,2
2,"the Constitution prohibits the government frominterfering with those liberties-- like thought, speech, press, association, worship, self-defense, travel, privacy, due process, use of money and private property",2
2,The teaching of these founding documents isthat our liberties are natural--their source is not the government,2
2,"they are personal, not collective",2
2,We don't need a government permission slipto exercise them,2
2,we don't needto belong to a groupto enjoy them,2

1,"This demonstratesthat our political leaders do not believethat our rights are inalienable, but can be interfered with and regulated by them",0
1,They have written lawsthat literally permitfederal agents to do the very actsthe Constitution was writtento prohibit,0
3,Take the lethal combination of war and debt,1
1,Both parties support perpetual war and perpetual debt,0
1,"The leadership of both parties has permitted every modern presidentto kill whomeverhe pleases in foreign countries without lawful declarations of warand to do so bygoing into a $17 trillion hole of debt,with no end in sight",0
1,"Today, 20 cents of every tax dollar collected goes to interest on pre-existing government debt",0
1,Today's taxpayers are still paying interest on the $30 billionWoodrow Wilson borrowedto financeWorld War Iin 1917,0

1,"Unlesswe have a radical change in the direction of government -- its size, cost, focus, intrusiveness and rejection of first principles -- andunlesswe elect people to the governmentwho truly believethe Declaration and the Constitution meanwhatthey say,we will continue our march toward the federal destruction of the presumption of liberty",0

5,"The main opposition party, SYRIZA, openly invested in the constitutional opportunityto overturn the government months agoclaimingthat its endurance in office for two more years would be abnormalasit would contradict the popular sentiment tracked in every opinion poll during the past yearor so",2

1,"Despite the factthat both the German and the Greek conservative governments present the current bailout programme as a ""success story"",most analysts around the globe agreethat it has actually failed",0
4,Six years of continuing recession have resulted in a loss of 25 percent of GDP and a rise of unemployment to 27 percent,2
1,Greek debt is well over 170 percent of GDP now,0
5,according to Troika estimations it will be no less than 120 percent by 2020,2
1,These facts translate to two things,0
1,there can be no development under austerity policies for the majority of the population,0
1,even ifthe Eurozone fixes its competitiveness problem and exits deflationandthe Greek economy startsdeveloping at a growth rate of over 4 percent ,0
1,which is highly unlikely,0
1,"Secondly, there can be no functioning democracyso long asGreece is not given choices other than poverty, degrowth and exclusion",0
1,"Greece is in the state of protectorate at the moment, bound in a bailout agreementthat strips its abilityto produce and reject different solutions",0
1,But it's not just Greece,0
1,Spain follows the same path both in regards to the social crisis and the political management of that crisis,0
1,Poverty and unemployment figures look much like the Greek ones and the Spanish conservative government resorts to authoritarian measuresin orderto keep the Spanish society tight,0
1, the public security law voteda few days ago is a clear attempt of the governmentto muzzle protests over its handling of the financial crisis,0
1,"Deflation hits Europe and the prospects of its biggest economies like France's, Italy's and Germany's, are not looking goodto pull the Eurozone back to the track of growth",0
1,"As a result, political forcesthat question austerityare gaining momentum",0
1,"they are nationalist Euroskeptic and even fascist, or progressive, democratic and pro-European like the Spanish ally party of SYRIZA, Podemos",0
1,Whatis striking about SYRIZAisthat its critique and analysis since 2009 have been provento be correct despite the continuing fear campaign against him both inside and out of the country,0
1,Recently Prime Minister Antonis Samaras accused the party of the radical leftthat it will lead Greece to default and bankruptcyifit triesto negotiate lighter terms for the repayment of the Greek debt,0

1,evenMorgan Stanley asksbond holders not to be afraid of the coming elections,0
1,"Despite the fear-mongering campaign, economic analysts reject now a possible ""grexit"" due to markets' beliefthat some kind of deal is preferable both for Greece and the EU",0
1,"In this environment, a SYRIZA victory would mean two very important things; the return of the powerto decide to a democratically elected government and the restoration of inclusiveness and national sovereignty and the opening of a new chapter in European politics",0
1,wherethe parties and the organisationswho challenge austeritywill have the momentum,0
1,The Greek people have patiently given the opportunity to the neoliberal technocrats of the IMF and the EU along with their local counterparts in the conservative coalition government to experiment and find a way out of the mess for more than five yearsonlyto receive back pain and failure,0
1,Now they're being given the opportunityto exercise their democratic rightto choosewhich waythe country will turn,0

1,But they are the same oneswho gave credence to Obama's claimsthat an obscure YouTube video was the cause for a terror attackthat killed a U.S  ambassador,0
1,Not the Islamic monsterswho did the attack,0
1,Remember the media reaction to the riots over Danish cartoons depicting Mohammad in 2005,0
4,Two hundred people died in global riots,2
1,"Even now, the newspaperthat published the cartoonsmust boost security",0
1,But it wasn't justwhetherto run the images,0

5,"He added,""Muslims do not believe in the concept of freedom of expression.""",2
1,That anti-freedom argument iswhatnews outlets are surrendering to,0

0, presidential elections were just around the corner,2
0,"Asthe drawdown of the international troops drew nearer,we fearedthat the political climate would makeit increasingly difficultto get the law anchored in parliament",2
0, we fearedthat any peace talks with the Taliban could end upsacrificing EVAW in a bidto appease the militants,2
1,Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition inprotecting it against extremist attacks,0
0,"In orderto get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament,we worked tirelessly for months,using three main strategies",2
0,"Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with thosewho opposed the law, mainly conservatives",2

0,Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two yearsto develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives,2
0,"In late 2009, there were only two issues leftwhereconservative MPs did not agree",2
0,"These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the factthat women's rights advocates wantedto include ""honour killings"" as a specific crime in the law",2

0,"As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011",2
0,At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions,2
0,All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions,2
0,"The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments",2
1,"Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposalto have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan",0
0,"As before, we rejected the proposalsto leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts",2
0,We similarly rejected a new suggestion,2
0,which wasto close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violenceto stay with relatives instead,2
0,Althoughthe opponents were vocal,2
0,they did not outnumber the rest,2
1,"Whatwas damaging,however, was an unhealthy political rivalrythat ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW",0
0,"Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, arguedthat the time was not rightto pass the EVAWandthat it should be left as a presidential decree",2
1,There were good reasons forseeking parliamentary approval,0
0,Yet some of my colleagues beganaccusing me ofusing the billto further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections,2
0,"Instead ofsupporting EVAW,many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill",2
0,some even went as far asto lobby against it,2
1,"As a result,whenthe law was presented to the plenary in May 2013,conservative MPswho were opposedto EVAWwere further emboldened",0
1,The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence,0
1,"probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either",0
0,"With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failedto pass",2
0,"Those of uswho saw the passing of EVAWto be beyond politics,and understood its importance fortackling violence against women,were left heartbroken",2
1,"With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women",0
1,We have made important gains since 2001,0
1,we needthe force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements,0
1,We needto arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW lawto fight the violence and other ills of our society,0
1,which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country,0
1,The factthat the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliamentis the reason for its weak implementation rates,0
1,many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it,0
1,One promising thing on the horizon isthat we now have a president and chief executivewho both understand the multitude of challenges facing women,0
1,I would liketo take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullahto declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill,0
1,I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partnersto set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill,0
1,"As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows,whenthe government and others makesomething a priority,the conservative MPs can be isolated",0
1,Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan,0
1,differences may be wide,0
1,security challenges are growing,0
1,failureto back the EVAWand allowingit to diewill deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights,0
1,success at the state level were enoughto recommend someone for president of the United States,0
1,Gov  Mike Pence of Indiana would be among the frontrunners for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination,0
5,"According to the governor's office, Pence has ""signed into law $643 million in annual tax relief",2
5,"That includes: $313 million for hardworking Hoosiers, thanks to last year's 5 percent income tax reduction, the largest state tax cut in Indiana history.""",2
4," the state corporate tax rate was reduced from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent,makingit the third lowest in the countryand contributing to Indiana's increase in the labor force",2
5,"which,Pence's office says,has grown by more than 51,000 over the past year, five times the national growth rate",2
1,It helpsto have large majorities of one's party in the legislature,0
1,Pence consults and has good relationships with Democrats,0
1,who frequently vote with the Republican majoritybecausehis programs work,0
5,"Sitting with the governor in his high-ceiling office beneath portraits of two Indiana governorswho became presidents of the United StatesPence tells me he is focused on the upcoming legislative session,which is expectedto last four months,and won't think seriously aboutrunning for presidentuntilthe session ends",2
5,"he says,""We'll probably take some time as a familyto reflect and pray and make decisions about our future.""",2
1,"In his mind, Pence may have already crafted a winning scenario",0
1,He may be focused on his state,0
1,he thinks a lot about the country,0
1,which he served for 10 years as a congressman,0
1,"A former Democrat (like his ideological mentor Ronald Reagan), Pence seesa need to transform his party's image",0
5,"""The Republican Party has become just the other party to Washington solutions",2
5,We haveto get back to advancing state- based solutions and reforms,2
5,"We must be relentlessly optimistic.""",2
5,"He paraphrases a Reagan line:""'Whyshouldn'twe dream great dreams,after all we're Americans",2
5,There was a confidence and optimismI thinkour party would do wellto repair to,2
5,There's a lot wrong with our national government,2
5,"we've gotto stopconfusing our national government with our nation.""",2
1,That's a good line for a stump speech,0
1,"Pence wantsto move fromopposing bad ideas in Washington, tofocusing on the success records in many states",0
0,Pence's education agenda includes a goal oftaking children in underperforming schools and putting them in good schools,2
5,"""By the year 2020, I want 100,000 more Indiana students in high- quality schoolsthanwe have today",2
5,"Today, we have 105,000 kidswho are in underperforming or failing schools.""",2
1,"He wantsto fix traditional schools, pay good teachers more,giving bonuses to the best,and expand vocational education to every high school in the state",0
5,"""We have the largest education voucher program in America",2
5,"I wantto expand that bylifting the cap and encouraging more private investment.""",2
0,Indiana also has 75 charter schools,2
1,Pence declines an invitationto comment on former Gov  Jeb Bush's recent remarks abouthavingto lose the primaryin orderto win the general election,0
1,which many conservatives view as an attack on the party's base,0
1,Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic Party's presidential nominee,0
1,"I asked,is she beatable?",0
0,"Pence answers indirectly,sayinghe thinks2016 will be the first foreign policy election since 1980",2
5,"that as a former secretary of state, Clinton will have some advantages",2
1,That'swhyhe thinksthe eventual GOP nominee should doasGeorge W  Bush did in 2000,0
1,he is successful,0
1,some might serve in his administration,0
1,Mike Pence is a model of humility and restraint,0
1,some characterize Obama as a failed president,0
1,"Pence will only labelhis tenure ""disappointing.""",0
1,"That in itself is in sharp contrast to the hubris, narcissism and self-awareness of Obama",0
1,"Humility, coupled with a proven track record of success and more confidence in the states and the people, iswhat'sneeded at the national level",0
1,Mike Pence could be the oneto bring it,0
5,"A recent report , according to Reuters, findsthat ""more than 3,000 students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill received credit for fake classes over an 18-year period as part of a programthat allowed many of themto remain eligibleto play sports.""",2
1,"But college sports scandals, like the one at North Carolina, are missing the point",0
1,We should not be focusing onhowthe university broke the rules of college sports for almost 20 years bysending thousands of athletes to no-show classesto keepplayers eligible for play,0
1,"We should not even be askingwhetherthe University of South Carolina and several other NCAA schools should guarantee four-year, ""full cost of attendance""scholarships",0
1,The real question is far more basic,0
1,Why dosomany colleges treat their star athletes better than their star students?,0
1,"The comparison betweenhowcolleges treat athletes and high performing, low- income studentsis particularly revealing",0
1,Student athletes are sought out,0
1,once identifiedthey are actively recruited,0
1,admission comes with generous scholarships,0
1,"once admitted students are pampered with better housing, free or subsidized food and special college counselingto helpthem adjust to college life",0
1,"High performing, low-income students, in contrast, take out loans, engage in work-study programs and,once admitted,are left largelyto fend for themselves",0
1,We simply aren't doing enoughto help academically gifted studentswho have financial needto offset the challenges ofattending college,0
1,"First generation college goers,attending schools far away from home and family,are often quite fragile",0
1,"As a result, the smart-but-poor struggle",0
4,Only 59% of children from low-income households scoring in the top quartile on standardized tests go onto graduate from a 4-year college,2
4,77% of children with similar scores but from wealthy families earn bachelor's degrees,2
4,"Worse, fully 17% of the top quartile of poor kids do not even apply to college",2
1,Recruited Tar Heel athletes haveit far easier,0
1,Many factors contribute to this disparity,0
1,"one of the most significant obstacles preventing high-achieving, low-income students fromattaining their full potentialisthey exist in isolation in high school",0
1,They do their part in school but are held backbecausethey aren't identifiedand given support and guidancethey need,0
1,There is no football coach or athletic counselor for these kids,0
1,"they are on their ownto develop a college selection strategy, navigate the maze of loan forms and develop a college budget",0
1,"Ironically, the waybig-time college athletes are recruitedofferssolutions to address this problem",0
1,We should seek out talented students from poor backgroundsthe way athletics coaches search for high school athletes,0
2,Coaches knowpart of their job isto find and cultivate talent,2
1,they sendscouts to take in countless high school games looking for the next Tom Brady,0
1,Admissions counselors often visit schools in wealthy suburbs,0
1,wheremost of the best students are college-bound anyway,0
1,How oftendo they visit schools in impoverished areas looking for the next Sonia Sotomayor?,0
1,"Whatifcolleges had academic scoutsto scour science fairs, mathematics competitions, art shows, and schoolplaysseeking out the super smart, highly-diligent, poor kid?",0
1,Star athletes are also celebrated by their local media and ranked in nationwide publications,0
1,They go from small-town heroes tocatching the attention of the best athletic programs in the country,0
1,There is nothing comparable for the smart kid,0
1,We are a long way from the revenge of the nerds,0
1,Half the high schools in this country don't even have college counselors,0
1,"wherethey do exist,the quality providedis often abysmal",0
1,either becausethe counselors have enormous caseloads or lack the resources and experience,0
0,"whenI was Schools Chancellor,one New York high school had a single college counselor for 2,000 students",2
1,"Coaches also recruit byinviting potential applicantsto make""official visits"" paid for by the college",0
1,"which can include transportation, daily meals, a roomto stay in during visits, even entertainment expenses",0
1,"For many low-income, academically-gifted students, a paid college visit, especially one catered to their academic interests, is completely out of reach",0
1,"Until the recent initiative led by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the College Board, the application fee itself was a barrier",0
1,Do we really wantto tell studentsthat catching ballsis more important thanacing tests?,0
0,"Consider NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, for years an undiscovered talent",2
0,He excelled but failedto gain attention from the best football programs like Ohio State or Oklahoma,2
0,"So he attended Mississippi Valley State University,wherehe was finally recognizedand went onto have one of the best football careers of all time",2
1,Whatifhe had never picked up a ball?,0
1,"whatiftoday we failto recognize academic talent in poor neighborhoods,never developing the whiz kids?",0
1,WhatifAlbert Einstein had become an accountant or Neal DeGrasse Tyson a telephone repairman?,0
1,We do not needto endsports scholarships to address this issue,0
1,we just needto level the playing field,0
1,"Byplacing athletics ahead of academics, many colleges are making profoundly poor choices",0
1,The cost to our society of unrealized academic potential is unfathomable,0
0,"My organization was founded by a legendary sportsman, Jack Kent Cooke",2
1,who knewthere was too much untapped potential in the nation's young people,0
0,He left the bulk of a fortune fromowningthe Redskins to start the largest academic scholarship foundation in America,2

0,The ruling was made public Tuesday,2
5,"The EEOC determinedthere was reasonable causeto believe the Phillipsburg School District discriminated against Walt Tutka, a substitute teacher",2

5,"""Thisis a great indicationthe EEOC is taking religious liberty seriouslyandthey are goingto enforce the law-- andin this case make sureWalt's rights are protected,""Liberty Institute attorney Hiram Sasser told me",2
2,Liberty Institute is a law firmthat specializes in religious liberty cases,2
5,"""Thissends a message to school districtsthat their natural allergic reaction to religion is misplaced,andnot only is it wrong-- butit's also an egregious violation of the law,""Sasser said",2
0,"AsI first reported,Tutka was working as a substitute teacher on Oct  12, 2013",2
1,whenhe ran afoul of school policies,0
0,"He tolda straggling student at the end of a line, ""The first shall be lastandthe last shall be first.""",2
0,The student asked on a number of occasionswherethe line was from,2
0,Tutka told himit was from the Bible,2
0,he discoveredthe child did not have a Bible,2
0,Tutka gave him his personal copy,2
1,It was not all that unusual,0
0,"becauseTutka is a member of Gideons International, a ministry known forproviding Bibles to school children across the world",2

0,wherehe was accused ofviolating a school policythat bans the distribution of religious materials and anotherthat directsteachers to be neutralwhendiscussion religious material,2

1,"In recent years, the South China Seahas (once again)transformed into a theatre of competition among rival claimant states",0
1,"Outmatched and outgunned by China,the Philippines has soughtto resolve the disputes byresorting to legal arbitration, hopingthat international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), will serve as an amicable basis for settling maritime conflicts",0
1,But China has unequivocally rejected the arbitration process as an infringement on its national sovereignty and territorial integrity,0
0,recently releasing a position paperthat details its rationale foropposing any third-party intervention in the disputes,2
1,The South China Sea represents a potential flashpoint with global ramifications,0
4,"Connecting one of the most dynamic economies of the 21st century,the waters facilitate more than $5 trillion in annual trade",2
0,"Crucially, the bulk of the energy imports of industrial powerhouses such as Japan and South Korea pass through the South China Sea",2
1,The very economic survival and energy security of major Asian economies is anchored by unimpeded access to international waters such as the South China Sea,0
1,Almost everyone has an interest in the peaceful settlement of the disputes,0
1,But it is far from certainwhetherthe Philippines' legal manoeuvre will contribute to the de-escalation of maritime tensions,0
0,"China has vehemently rejected the entire arbitration process,accusing the Philippines ofstirring troubleand jeopardising historically stable bilateral ties",2
0,"Technically, the maritime disputes involve six rival claimant states: China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan",2
1,"The bitterest disputes, however, involve China, on one hand, and the Philippines and Vietnam, on the other",0
1,"Fortunately, the latest wave of maritime spats hasn't yet sparked a full-scale military confrontation",0
1,The last bloody standoff was in the latter decades of the Cold War,0
0,"whenChina triedto wrest control of the Paracel (1974)andthe Spratly (1988) islands from the South Vietnamese and (united) Vietnam forces, respectively",2
1,"But amid a flurry of nationalist bombast, backed up by wide-ranging - civilian and military - construction activities as well as paramilitary patrols across disputed areas, there are growing concerns over accidental clashes and unintended escalation in the high seas",0
1, freedom of navigation (FoN) - a pillar of commerce and trade - in the South China Sea could be in peril,0
1,"Given the significance of the South China Sea to regional trade and security, non-claimant states such as the US, Japan, and Indonesia have also been drawn into the territorial disputes",0
1,"Washington is bound by treaty obligationsto defend Asian allies such as the Philippines,against external aggression",0
1,Assome commentators would put it,0
1,"the maritime rivalries resemble a three-dimensional chess game, threatening strategic, economic, and political interests in the region, with ever-growing number of players injecting additional layers of complexity and risk to the problem",0
1,all actors have contributed to the escalation of tensions in the area,0
1,"the consensus among independent experts isthat China's sweeping claims, particularly its notorious ""nine-dashed line"" doctrine, has served as a major stumbling block inresolving the territorial disputes",0
1,China's claims are simultaneously expansive and ambiguous,0
0,"The ""nine-dashed line"" covers almost the entirety of the South China Sea, even overlapping with Indonesia's waters",2
1,Beijing has not clarified its precise coordinates,0
1,"It isn't clearwhetherChina is claiming the land features and their surrounding territorial waters, or treating the entire area as an internal lake",0

1,Lebanon has just done the apparently unthinkable and placed visa control on the entry of Syrians into the country,0
4,"Before, the situation was effectively a free flowthat had resulted in Syrians, mostly refugees, amounting today to 20 percent of the population on Lebanese soil",2
1,Imagine 12 million French in the UK today,0
5,The Lebanese government has assured international agenciesthat it will still permit and facilitate humanitarian cases,2
1,the step is a telling one,0
1,The real story behind this is the annihilation of borders from Baghdad to Beirut,0
1,"ISIL is one stark and ugly manifestation ofthat reality but so are the refugees, a tragic eventthat has also affected Turkey and Jordan",0
1,This zonethat once facilitated tradeis now closer to scenes from Road Warrior - or the sad march of the displaced,0
1,The disintegration of Sykes Picot has blurred nation-states,0
1,"cross border allegiances fight it out on a series of fronts and through a myriad of forcesfrom Jubhat al-Nusra, Shia militias, Peshmergas, to the Lebanese Armed forces to the now infamous ISIL",0
1,Borders don't seemto mean much in this Middle East,0
1,they ever did,0
2,The refugees are the terrible consequence and victims of these conflictsthat plague this area,2
1,The best response to them is not visas but a proper joint response by the Lebanese government assisted by international insititutions,0
1,The reality however isthat the former is incapable,0
1,the latter insufficiently fundedto deal with such a massive influx,0
1,"As a result, many refugees are living in terrible conditions",0
5,"The other harsh reality isthat the Lebanese government has saidthat this will not affect Syrian ""visitors"" to Lebanon",2
1,There are six classes of visitors in the new system,0
1,the Syrian middle class and rich are unlikleyto be affected,0
5,"Walid Jumblatt statedthat his country should differentiate between ""refugeeswho are fleeing death and destruction in Syriaafterthey lost their homes,""and thosewho intendto be politically active",2
1,the reality isthat the poorest will be most affected,0
1, it's a large question markwhetherLebanon has the capacityto even implement the measureit has just taken,0
1,"The Syrian presence in Lebanon is so pervasiveit may well be impossibleto manage the situation,exceptto manage some future inflow",0
1," the idea of Lebanon, a country barely treading water, being ableto manage such a problemis unrealistic",0
1,Only a regional and international effort of significance can manage such a scale,0
1,regional powers are busycarving their fiefdoms and creating the very problem rather than solving it,0
1,The plight of the refugees is key,0
1,it is also importantto perceive this event from the perspective of the host country; a small nation with very poor governance and infrastructure in the midst of regional turmoil,0
1,"In a way, this is Lebanon's very small response to the erosion of Sykes Picot",0
1,Syrians are indeed everywhere in Lebanon,0
1,"In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits",0
1,Flights from Beirut to Europe are one-third to half full of Syrians,0
1," given this massive presence and Lebanon's already poor infrastructure and socio-economic state, it is an achievementthat the Syrian crisis has not led to further deterioration in the country",0
1,"The relations in Lebanon between the two peoples, despite some racism and ugly incidents, could have been far worse",0
1,"Until now, Lebanese hosting of the refugees is characterised by neither generosity nor enmity, but by a passive acceptance of fate",0
1,This is partially driven by the factthat Syrians are culturally and linguistically akin,0
1,"some sectors of the Lebanese economy, e.g  construction, remain highly dependent on Syrian workers",0
1,Howthis will square with the new visarules is unknown,0
1,"More importantly, this step can be seen as part of a series of recent indirect actionsthat attemptto strengthen the Lebanese state, or at least make the pretense ofdoing so",0
0,"Minister of Health Abu Faour has been on an intense and mediatic campaignto clean up the food industry in Lebanon,cracking down restaurants, slaughterhouses, and airport storage sites",2
1,"Despite complaints,this clean up,ifit lasts,is a welcome step for Lebanese",0
1,"it is national, potentially affects everyone positively, and is an act of government",0
0," in an echo of the Nahr el-Bared campaign, the Lebanese army is taking responsibility in the Northern Bekaa and Hermel areas against the radical groups",2
1,who are effectively fighting the Syrian war on Lebanese soil,0
1,Pride in the Lebanese army is rising,0
1,There are also rumoursthat the Lebanese government will also take on the murderous Indie-500 speeders on Lebanse highways in the spring,0
1,this does occur in addition to bold step of visas for Syrians,0
1,"a movethat would have been unheard ofwhenLebanon was effectively a vassal state of Damascus, then indeed Lebanoncould see the bare beginnings ofemerging out of chaos through these small attempts",0
1,The political realities in Lebanon are of course more complicated and illusory than this,0
1,Many only see in all of the above feeble attemptsto deflect from the reality of a total political vaccuum,0
1,the Lebanese visa step is obviously not humanitarian,0
1,"it is a self-interested attempt to stem the tide, put a thumb in the dyke, and avoid the emergent chaos in the Middle East",0
1,"It would be betterthe Lebanese had the magnamity, or much more importantly, the capacity",0
1,to continue simplyreceiving all Syrians,0
1,they are barely running their own country,0
1,Compassion requires an orderly method and capacitiesin orderto be effectively pursued,0
2,the Lebanese needa functioning state of their own to handle such a crisis properly,2
1," Lebanon has mostly escaped the wars next door not out of wisdom or discipline, or any energetic international diplomacy, but because the memoriesof that conflict are still vivid in the minds of Lebanese adults",0
1,No one will go to war,0
1,becausethey rememberwhat warcosts,0
1,becausethey knowhow littlethey derived from the devastation,0
1,"The result of 15 years of fighting wasthat the state was further weakened in favour of sectarianism, cronyism and corruption",0
1,"whilethe Lebanese kept ondoingwhatthey dobest, make money and enjoy life,living for today and certainly not tomorrow",0
1,"Meanwhile, social and environmental erosion makethe country less and less livableby the day",0
1,"The recent steps however, triggered by political challenges and health risks,signal some early and feeble attempts at a return of the state,or at the very least preserving the semblance of the old order, the shadow of a nation-state, amidst the dark fluidity and chaos surging from there to Kurdistan",0
1,It took the Lebanese 40 years and external pressuresto beginto think aboutgetting their house in order,0
1,that is indeedwhatis happening today,0
1,"Hopefully, it won't take their neighboursthat longto startto address the necessary basics of life",0
0,"On January 6, Iraq will hold its annual Army Day parade in Baghdad",2
1,The ceremony evokes mixed feelings amongst Iraqis,0
1, the parade marches under massive crossed swords wielded by giant bronze hands modelled on those of Saddam Hussein himself,0
1,"For the Kurds it is an ominous ritual, a leftover from an erawhenBaghdad's military power far outstripped that of the KurdsandwhenIraqi state power was used ruthlessly against northern rebellions",0
1,"The strongerthe Iraqi army gets,the Kurds reckon, the more chanceit will be used against Kurdistan again",0
2,"Iraq's Sunnis were the leading force within the Iraqi army since its foundation on January 6, 1921",2
1," the Sunnis fondly remember the pre-2003 army as a national institution of unrivalled prestige but view today's Iraqi army as a weak shadow of its former self, dominated by Shia officers",0
1,The views of Iraq's Shia community may be more complex,0
1,"Before 2003, the Iraqi military was regularly used as a tool of oppression against the Iraqi Shia",0
1,many older Shia also remember the army as a symbol of modernity and Arab nationalist pride,0
1,"With a Shia-led government in Baghdad, young Shia were beginningto recognise the army as a friendly institution",0
1,"The collapse of Iraqi army divisions in northern and western Iraq in June 2014 dented the army's reputation, with recent victories being credited to the predominately-Shia popular mobilisation militias (al-Hashd al-Shaabi) or else the tiny cadre of special forces - the so-called Golden Division",0
1,This is a critical year for the Iraqi army,0
1,which is in danger oflosing its status as the nation's premier armed force,0
4,"In 2009,whenthe US-led""train and equip""effort reached its zenith,the Iraqi army fielded 55 combat brigades with approximately 210,000 troops",2
4,"The Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MoI) fielded around 30 smaller brigades,totaling around 120,000 troops",2
4,"Today the Iraqi army fields 40 weak brigades with a total combat strength of around 48,000 troops",2
4," the MoI survivedthe summer comparatively welland now fields 24 brigades,totaling around 36,000 troops",2
1,The gap has narrowed between the two security ministries,0
1,"In addition to the army and MoI, there are two other security forcesthat are on the rise",0
1,One is the Popular Mobilisation forces,0
4,"which seemto field approximately 100,000 troops, including a well-trained offensive cadre of around 20,000 fighters",2
1,The final potential force is the National Guardthat is being considered as an option by Iraqi politicians,0
1,"This force would, in theory, be trained, equipped and paid by the federal government,whilst being recruited and operated by the provincial councils",0
0,"In a step towards this concept, a 5,000-strong US-equipped Tribal Security Force brigade has been provided with $13.5 million worth of US weapons and training in the new US Department of Defense budget",2
1,It is now up to Iraq's governmentwhetherthe country will pay these troops as part of the first National Guard units in the forthcoming 2015 budget,0
1,"It is also unclearexactly which ministry would administer the training, equipping and paying of National Guard troops: the US-backed Ministry of Defense (MoD) under Minister Khalid al-Ubeidi, a Sunni from Mosul, or the MoI,led by Badr leader Mohammed Ghabban, a close lieutenant of Badr leader Hadi al-Amiri",0
1,The scheme could become a way ofpermanently employing the Popular Mobilisation forces in the National Guard units of the predominately-Shia southern provinces,0
1,"Withthe Kurdish Peshmerga representing another large force of around 54 brigades with 113,000 troops,the Iraqi army is thus on-trackto become one of the smaller security forces in Iraq",0
1,"In 2015, the army's performance and the international support provided to Iraq's MoD will be critical factors indetermining the future of this proud institution",0
1,"In the background, the slow process ofrebuilding the armyhas already begun",0
0,"New half-manned brigades are popping up at training bases in Nasiriya, Kirkush and at the collection points for the shattered army divisions across north- central Iraq",2
1,More units will follow in the coming months,0
0,"Meanwhile a US-funded $1.6 billion train and equip programme will aimto produce a further nine full-strength Iraqi army brigades in 2015,adding a further 45,000 troops to the army and nearly doubling its frontline combat strength",2
0,"(Three Peshmerga brigades or 15,000 troops will also be re-equipped under the programme)",2
0,"The first of 250 US-provided Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles have arrived in Iraq, sent directly by the United States at no cost from Afghanistan",2
0,"Another 3,496 tactical vehicles (Hummers, trucks, fuel tankers and engineering vehicles) will also be provided to the Iraqi army cost-free by the US military",2
1,"Iraq will probably buy a further 1,000 newly-built M1151A1 up-armoured Hummers in 2015",0
1,the US follows through on its pledges of training and equipment,0
1,"the Iraqi army could survive its disastrous year in 2014 and play a key role in the struggleto evict Islamic State of Iraqandthe Levant (ISIL) forces from cities like Mosul, Tikrit, Ramadi and Fallujah",0
1,The Iraqi army can draw on some illustrious history,0
0,"In 1973, it deployed 18,000 troops with 300 tanksto save Damascus during the ""October War""",2
1,"this feat, mustering and moving an army 1,200km in just six days, remains deeply impressive",0
1,"Iraq's five lightning offensives in April, May and June of 1988 shattered the Iranian army and were textbook examples of planning and execution",0
1,"the Iraqi army can be rebuilt with Shia, Sunni Arab and Kurdish political support",0
1,the well-led Ministry of Defense can guide the National Guard initiative,0
1,the coming year could witness new Iraqi army victories at Mosul,0
1,"Successful operations undertaken by this national institution, with deep roots in the Iraq's history, will be far more beneficial to the countrythanvictories scored solely by Shia militias or local Sunni uprisings, either ofwhich could further fracture Iraq",0
1,The attack on the Charlie Hebdo office was one of the deadliest attacks against civilians in France since 1980 and the most serious waged against a newspaper since the war in Algeria,0
0,Twelve people were killed by men armed with Kalashnikovs at the headquarters of this satirical weekly in Paris,2
1,Could this attack have been motivated by the editorial slant of the newspaperthat has been subject to threats?,0
1,"Could this attack have been perpetrated by foreign groupsto ""punish"" Francefor its commitment in Mali or Chad?",0
0,Police in France have identified and released the photographs of two brothers suspectedto be involved in the attack,2
1,"whileearly speculation focused on the premisethat Muslim extremists were behind the dreadful act, especially given the magazine's long history ofsatirising Islam and other religions",0
0,The two brothers have been identified as 32-year-old Said Kouachi and 34-year-old Cherif Kouachi,2
1,This attack must be condemned with the utmost firmness and its perpetrators arrested and convicted,0
2,"Nothing can justify such an act;whateverthe reasons,whoever the perpetrators",2
1,But we also haveto understand the context,0
1,asthis aggression could arouse dangerous reactions within French society,0
0,Charlie Hebdo was founded in February 1969,2
1,It was then politically positioned on the extreme left with anarchist tendencies and a taste for provocation,0
0,"In November 1970, following the death of General de Gaulle, it published a cover with the headline: ""Tragic prom in Colombey [de Gaulle's city of origin], one dead""",2
0,which resulted init being banned by the Ministry of Interior,2
0,"But since 2000, under its new editor Philippe Val, Charlie Hebdo shifted direction,taking a stand against the Palestinians and supporting the Israeli aggression against Lebanon in 2006",2
1,This came during the second Intifada,0
1,"At the same time, the newspaper startedto launch Islamophobic campaigns",0
0,"In 2006, it republished the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammadthat were previously published in Denmark",2
1,"A number of intellectuals then pointed outthat whilein France we cannot accept censorship, sometimesit can be irresponsibleto publish drawingsfuelling sectarian tensions in the country",0
0,"In March 2006, Val signed ""The Twelve's Manifesto: Together Against the New Totalitarianism"" published in the weekly magazine L'Express, by Bernard-Henri Levy, Caroline Fourest, and Antoine Sfeir",2
5,"""Afterhaving overcome Fascism, Nazism and Stalinism,the world now faces a new global threat of a totalitarian nature:Islamism.We - writers, journalists and intellectuals - call for resistance against religious totalitarianism andto promote freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all.""",2
1,But these positions dividedthe team and several members resigned,0
0,"Whileclaimingto stand for press freedom,Charlie Hebdo dismissed one of its star cartoonists, Sine, due to false accusations of anti-Semitism",2
1,"It then came as no surprisethat,whenelected,President Nicolas Sarkozy promoted Philippe Val to executive editor of France-Inter (a public radio station)",0
1,press freedom cannot be compromised,0
1,the situation currently rocking Paris is all the more condemnableshowingthat this could have serious consequences on the internal situation in France,0
1,"It may encourage a wave of Islamophobiathat overwhelms the country- as well as other European countries - and could designate Muslims as the ""internal enemy""",0
1," perhaps it is about timeto engage in a substantive debate on the ""war against terrorism"" revived by the West and the ""international community"", in the aftermath of the expansion of ISIL",0
1,"Assessing the outcomes of such a campaign (more violent actions around the world, finding justifications for attacks on freedom, new anti-terrorism legislation, worsening sectarian tensions, more support for Middle East dictatorships and so on),isn't it about timeto change our methods?",0
1,Remember,0
1,the wave of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 and 2012 resulted in a loss of credit for al-Qaeda,0
1,asthey paved a path for political and democratic change in Arab countries,0
0,"In a pre-dawn raid on Monday, militants attacked a Saudi border post from the Iraqi side of the frontier",2
0,The resulting clash leftthree soldiers and four militants dead,2
5,according to the Saudi government news agency,2
0,"It later emergedthat one of the dead soldiers was no ordinary border guard but the commander of Saudi Arabia's northern border forces, Brigadier General Awdah al-Balawi",2
1,"This suggeststhat the attack, far frombeing random or opportunistic,had been carefully targeted and perhaps based on inside information regarding the general's whereabouts",0
0,"The attack has been widely attributed to Islamic State, withsome reports sayingthe rebel group has now claimed responsibility for it",2
1,This might be viewed simply as a reprisal for Saudi participation in the US-led bombing campaign against Isis,0
1,Isis has also been seekingto extend the current conflict in Syria and Iraq into Saudi territory,0
1,There is no doubtthat Isis has both sympathisers and active supporters inside the kingdom,0
0,"it claimed responsibility forshooting a Danish citizen in Riyadh last November, for example",2
1,whetherit will be ableto establish a military footholdis another question,0
1,Isis tendsto flourish militarily in placeswherecentral government is weak,0
1,that is not the case in Saudi Arabia,0
1,"In military terms, the Saudi security apparatus is probably capable ofsuppressing Isis on its own territory",0
0,just asit did withal-Qaeda a decade or so ago,2
1,it is in no positionto confront Isis at the ideological level,0
1,The problem here isthat Isis and the Saudis' Islamic kingdom are ideologically similar,0
1,attemptsto challenge Isis on ideological groundsriskundermining the Saudi state too,0
0,Heba Saleh and Simeon Kerr noted in the Financial Times last September,2
1,"The underlying issue, therefore, is the rival claims of king and would-be caliph",0
5,"In the words of two Saudi government supporters:""To restore the 'caliphate',[Isis] would ultimately needto implant itself at the epicentre of Islamic life, the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina",2
5,"Therefore,[Isis's]road to the caliphate runs through the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""",2
1,"Inconveniently for the Saudi monarchy, this challenge from the upstart caliph comes at a time of uncertainty over the royal succession",0
0,"King Abdullah, now in his 90s, is in hospital - reportedly being treated for pneumonia ",2
0,"his likely successor, Crown Prince Salman, is thoughtto be 77 and not in good health",2
1,"So far, Saudi effortsto confront Isisideologically have mainly taken the form of denunciations from tame clerics - figureswho have no prospect ofinfluencing Isis supporters and sympathisers",0
1,it is difficultto seewhatelse they might do withoutcalling their own state system into question,0
1,The king and his princes have dug a hole for themselves byharnessing religion in the pursuit of power,0
1,Religious credentials bolstered their claim to legitimacy and helpedthem assert their authority,0
1,"For a long time,those credentials served them well",0
1,now they are becoming a liability,0
1,it may be too lateto unfasten the harness,0

0,A foreign friend was amazed by the quietness in Havana during the first hours,2
1,"Because of the way it happenedandwhatit means for the island,there is a feeling of parenthesisthat softens opinions",0
1,"After half-a-century of progressive shortages, fatigue, and the inevitable time it will take for changesto materialise,it took regular Cubans awhileto assimilate the surprising news",0
1,"Cuba is not a country ofwhatyou might call ""authored opinions"" with a variety of interpretations",0
1,The outcome of this event may be a continuation ofopposing political opinions between thosewho resist the regime and thosewho write an obituary to it every day,0
1,"Cuba and the US' disagreement didn't start with the Fidel Castro revolution, but with a struggle during colonial times",0
1,Cuba was the ungrateful daughter of the Spanish metropolis and the contemptuous bride of the emerging new world metropolis,0
1,"The clumsy reaction of the US,which included military occupations and transnational power games such as the obstinate blockade of the island,has now suddenly lost some of its arguments",0
0,"Just two days ago it was punishing banks and international companies forhaving relations with the island,which the US had designated as a state sponsor of terror",2
1,Wednesday's announcement foreshadows actions towards the normalisation of relations,0
1,"This ranges from economy to diplomacy, and will require a good temper at every step",0
1,"Obama's speech acknowledges the failure of the blockade, held by successive US governments for over 50 years",0
1,"On his side, the Cuban president made a call for equanimity and presented the news as patriotic and nationalistic encouragement",0
1,It turns outthat we are in front of a new stage,0
1,"Cuba was,possibly,the least Americanised of the nations in the hemisphere",0
1,it has lived a long chapter under a completely opposing ideology,0
1,Several generations of Cubans have never known the capitalistic past mythicised by its adversaries,0
1,"Many have only lived under the blockade, with sacrifices, resignations and daily efforts",0
1,It would be adventurousto attribute my impressions to the whole community,0

1,"In lieu of a strong self-concept, the young build themselves out of a mosaic of allegiances",0
1,The online world is fertile ground for these,0
0,"Tumblr, Twitter and 4chan, for example, are full of young people pledging fervent allegiance to a favorite fan culture, a political movement or a self-diagnosis, with all the rights, privileges, and rivalriesthat implies",2

1,Whatstops a man frombeating up and raping his female partner?,0
4,"According to research published today, it is not sanctions imposed by the criminal justice system, such as prison or probation, but attending a course with other abusers",2
0,"""Domestic violence perpetrator programmes (DVPPs): steps towards change"",by the feminist academics Liz Kelly and Nicole Westmarland, is based on interviews with menwho attend programmesthat aimto re-educate them about their behaviourto improve the safety of women and children",2
5,"The research -which also draws on the experiences of partners of the violent men, a small number of children and the staff of these programmes- findsthat ""the vast majority of menwho abusetheir partners stop their physical and sexual violenceifthey attend a DVPP"" and that such programmes""could play an important role in the questto end domestic violence""",2
1,Some of the figures look impressive,0
4,beforeattending the programmea third of men asked womento perform sexual acts against their wishes,2
4,none did so aftertaking part,2
4,Cases of the men using a weapon against their partner reduced from 29% to nil,2
1,But there are other findingsthat giveme cause for concern,0
4,"Ninety per cent of the men interviewed had, prior to the course, made excuses about and attemptedto justify their abusive behaviour",2
4,"After the course, this tendency had barely reduced at all, withalmost three-quarters of the men still making excuses",2
0,whenmaking plain my scepticism about DVPPsI have been toldthat the aim of such courses isto makeperpetrators accountableand getthem to face up towhatthey have done,2
1,This finding showsthat this is one of the weakest outcomes,0
1,What about prevention of domestic violence?,0
1,Does the existence of these courses deter others fromusing their fiststo settle an argument?,0
4,"On average, two women in England and Wales die each week as a result of domestic violence, a figurethat has remained constant for decades",2
1,"I can't imagine a government-led information campaign with the slogan,""Violent men beware!Beat up your wife and go on a course""",0
4,"Over half of the women reportedfeeling ""very safe"" after the programme, compared with less than one in 10 before it",2
4,But that leaves almost half of the women still in fear,2
1,One major tactic used by violent men isto control the household finances,0
1,so that the woman is totally reliant on him and has no means of escape,0
4,"The research foundthat after DVPP, this behaviour changed ""only marginally""",2
1,There is also some evidencethat DVPPs do not necessarily encouragewomen to leave violent men,0
0,The researchers used a control group of womenwho were accessing support for domestic violence,2
0,whose partnerwas not attending a DVPP,2
4,"The control group also reported a significant reduction in violence from the men, but were more likelyto end the relationship with the abuser than the women",2
4,whose partners were attending a DVPP,2
1,Perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together?,0
1,Is this not dangerous?,0
1,"The impression given by the widespread acceptability of these programmes isthat thosewho beat and rape their partnersare in need of support and help, not punishment",0
1,There are moves by the Home Officeto roll out restorative justice measures in cases of sexual and domestic violence,0
0,"a recent government inquiry intostalking legislationposed the question ofwhether""treatment programmes should be available for perpetratorsand,ifso,what should be their content?""",2
5,"According to Nicole Westmarland, one of the report authors,""we have hardly any knowledge abouthowthings like probation, fines, or even prison affect men's attitudes and behaviours towards women""",2
1,"This is true, but mainlyso few perpetrators are heldto account by the courts",0
1,We appearto have given up the battleto have domestic violence treated as a crime like any other -which usedto be the feminist mantra- and have now declared the criminal justice system unfit for purpose indealing with violence in the home,0
1,We should not be giving up on the justice systembeforeits potential effectiveness has been truly tested,0
1,There are many waysits approach to domestic violence could be improved,0
1,"Pilot programmes should be rolled out nationwide,directing policeto mandatorily arrest thosewho have committed acts of violence towards partners or ex-partners",0
1,perpetrators will realisethat it is not the decision of their victimsto send them to court,0
1,victims will be in no further danger of revenge fordoing so,0
1,The Crown Prosecution Service needsto take a more robust approach ingetting perpetrators to courtand speed up the processsothe victim does not haveto wait months for an outcome,0
1,"During this process, the victims involved should be protected and supported by state-funded initiatives",0
1,"Public education campaignsthat aimto tug on the heartstrings of abusers, such as posters depicting womencrying and sporting injuries,should be swapped for images of men in handcuffs or in a prison cell",0
1,Young women and men needto be educated aboutwhatis at the root of domestic and sexual violence,0
1,-that it is a cause and consequence of inequality and sexism,0
1,Peoplewho beat their partnersare making a choice,0
1,"We needto make sure the messagethat this isa serious crime, not an illness, is disseminated in schools",0

1,Twelve people were massacred in Paris on Wednesday merely forexpressing their opinion through art,0
1,Many might not like the artthat prompted the carnage,0
1,They may considerit obscene and even an attack on their faith,0
1,"But in the 21st, 15th or 57th century -whateveryour religion, calendar, or country- there is no excuse or justification forresponding to art with murder",0
1,"But there is a clear and frightening explanation for this violence, onethat demands not merely outrage at the act itself, but at the systemthat has madeitboth predictable and inevitable",0
1,"The problem isthat this system is hundreds of years old, implicates most everyone, and has only becomemore entrenched in the last several decades",0
1,asthe world has becomeever more globalised,0
3,Wheredoes the story begin?,1
1,It's no mere coincidencethat at least two of the Charlie Hebdo attackers are reportedly of Algerian descent and the third from Senegal,0
1,"France's 1830 invasion of Algeria began a 130-year odyssey of murder, expropriation, racism, exploitation and misrulethat only ended after a vicious anti-colonial struggle costing well over one million Algerian lives",0
5,"""Colonisationbrought the genocide of our identity, of our history, of our language, of our traditions""ishowPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika well describedit",2
1,"French rule in sub-Saharan West Africa was even more costly, particularly in the context of the centuries-long slave trade",0
1," as insomany newly independent countries, post-independence Algeria and Senegal were ruled by a governmentthat was tied umbilically to the former coloniser",0
1,"which,however ""postcolonial"" their official ideology and credentials,becameincreasing authoritarian and corrupt",0
1,"In Algeria, the petroleum-rich FLN state - known as ""the pouvoir"" because of its all-pervasive power - went so far asto launch a brutal internal warthat claimed 100,000 lives in the 1990s with the direct support of the West,all to preserve its absolute grip on power",0
1,"Nigeria, another major oil producer, received similar support for its even more ruinous war against Biafra in the late 1960s",0
1,"The devastationit caused,including at least one million dead, is one of the rarely discussed causes of the Boko Haram phenomenon",0
1,The experiences of Algeria and Senegal are in no way unique,0
1,They comprise the story of the modern Muslim world,0
1,"where with the exception of Turkey, Iran and part of the Arabian peninsula mostevery society from Morocco to Indonesia fell under generations of European rule in the 19th and 20th centuries",0
1,"The collective wound of colonialism, its distortion and often destruction of existing pathways to modernity, is for all practical purposes immeasurable",0
1,"As with a bodythe deep wounds of foreign domination and postcolonial dictatorship can take a lifetimeto heal properly,if ever",0
1," the chances of healing - of some level of local, democratically accountable control of political and economic development - have become even more remote in the era of neoliberal globalisation",0
1,which has been rightly seen by many across the region as essentially colonialism dressed in new clothes,0
1,"(IMF and World Bank policies strongly resemble those of the international banksthat brought Tunisia, Egypt and the Ottoman Empire to bankruptcy, and ultimately foreign control, between 1863 and 1875)",0
1,Radical Islam has today charted a paththat mirrors radical capitalism,0
1,"usingviolence only shocks ""us""",0
1,becausewe've managedto make the violence unleashed and supported for so long in our name morally and politically invisible,0
1,The major world powers have long coddled favoured local despots of whatever ideological stripe,0
1,"But the strength of the relationships between western governments and the petroleum-rich states of the Arab world, secured by trillions of dollarscycling back and forth between them through oil and arms sales, finance and heavy industry,is historically unprecedented",0
1,"Both are rapidly anti-democratic,support the concentration of wealth and power, and draw much of their strength from violence, war and a manageable level of chaosthat keepoil prices high and petrodollarsrecycled via everything from fancy weapons to even fancier real estate",0
1,Add to that the ongoing and well-documented structural racism against France's large Arab/Muslim and African communities,0
1,"which has included mass murder in the streets of Parisand remains ""rampant"" not merely in the poor suburbs of major cities",0
1,"whereconcentrated poverty and marginalisation lead so many to crime, drugs,prison and, not uncommonly, to radicalisation",0
1,"Whennewspapers such as the left-leaning Liberation declarethat ""Europe's leaders are in shock"" over the latest attack,their naivety is hardto forgive",0
1,Shocking?,0
1,"It's no more shockingthat some Muslims have becomepsychotic enough to murder, rape and pillage their way across eastern Nigeria and eastern Paristhanit isthat France, home of ""liberty"", ""equality"", and ""fraternity"", sells billions of dollars of weapons and otherwise provides political and diplomatic support to countriesthat practice the polar opposite of all three",0
1,that the US kills thousands of civilians with drones (and tens of thousands with conventional weapons)that are as merciless as the terroriststhey presumably target,0
1,"that Israel kills 1,500 Palestinians with the complete acquiescence of the US and Europe",0
1,"that most every Muslim government condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo routinely imprisons and tortures artists and activists for far less offensive expression, all with the support of the West",0
5,"As the Lebanese cartoonist Karl Sharro (aka Karl reMarks) points out,ultimatelythe violence against Charlie Hebdo is not about Islam per se",2
5,it's about a contemporary world systemthat is particularly adept atgrinding downwhateverdecent values exist in Islam and other faith systems (andin liberal capitalism as well),2
1,Decades of the combined onslaught of extreme capitalism and extreme religion have shaped a necropolitics of the oppressed,0

1,"this annual ritual leaves most people confused, depressed and overwhelmed",0
1,many will be faced with the additional step this year ofpaying hundreds or thousands of dollarsifthey chosenot to purchase health insurance under ObamaCare for 2014,0
0,"Under the individual mandate required by the president's new health care law, Americans for the first time must pay the higher of two penaltiesifthey are uninsured and did not enroll in ObamaCare last year--either $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18, or 1 percent of their yearly household income above the $10,000 tax filing threshold",2
0,"That meansan individual earning $50,000 will face a penalty of $400 this year",2
0,"fines could reach up to $2,448 per person or up to $12,240 for a family of five",2
1,"Unfortunately, these penalty rates will only continueto climb",0
0,"Next year, penalties will more than double for thosewho do not enroll in ObamaCare in 2015",2
0,"costing the same individual earning $50,000 per year a whopping $800, and families up to tens of thousands of dollars",2
1,No American should be forced into the president's one-size-fits-all health care mandate,0
1,Health care should be based on the fundamental principle of freedom,0
1,Americans should be ableto have the abilityto make their own health care decisions without fearthat the government will extract onerous penalties from them,0
1,"That iswhywe reintroduced The ObamaCare Opt-Out Act of 2014 in the Senate last week, important legislationthat will allow Americans to opt-out of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage required by ObamaCare",0
1,"This bill would allowindividuals to either notify their state or the federal health care exchange, or use their tax filing to opt-out of ObamaCare and avoid the penalty",0
5,"According to the tax-services provider H&R; Block, this would impact about 4 million uninsured Americans in 2015",2
1,"After four years of ObamaCare, hardworking Americans continueto see their health care costs risewhiletheir coverage choices diminish",0
1,It is far past time for American familiesto once again have the freedomto make their own decisions aboutwhatis best for their families,0

0,I'm not surewhenthe abnormal became normal,2
1,I remember a time not so long agowhena marathon runner was a mythical beast,0
1,we all knew someonewho knew someonewho had run a marathon,0
1,"most of us had only ever seen these creatures on the TV in their emaciated, long-limbed flow",0
1,now everyone knows a marathon runner,0
1,they just look like normal people,0
1,"Somewhere along the way,marathons became commonplace",0
1,a whole new breed of extreme activities came along-the Ironman triathlon; multi-day cycle events like John O'Groats to Lands End; crazy ultra marathons like the Thames Path 100; and eventsthat defy description like the Tough Mudder.,0
1,a lot of extreme challenges areto do with ultra endurance,0
1,the Tough Mudder is short but involvesgetting hurt.Sometimes by electric shocks.And fire,0
1,"Whatis wrong with you, Mudders?",0
1,I have no ideawhatcaused the rise of the extreme sports as a phenomenon,0
0,I do knowwhathappened for me,2
0,"After many years of corporate life and general indolence I foundmyself resting a glass of champagne on a large belly, unableto get to the buffet without puffing",2
0,"Horrified at the realisationthat I had become Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life,I resolved immediatelyto sign up for the Great Edinburgh Run",2
0,The GER was only 10k,2
0,it terrified me and filled me with doubts,2
0,whatifI came last?,2
0,Do I haveto run all the way?,2
0,Will I be the fattest dude on the course?,2
0,Four months later I completed it easily,2
0,And then I signed up for a marathon,2
0,And then an Ironman,2
1,And this is the thing - every step of the wayyou reassess your judgment ofwhatis crazy,0
1,It becomes a rapidly escalating obsession,0
1,Whatseemed like a hardcore event reserved solely for proper endurance loonssoon becomes just within reach,0
1,"Six years after the GER, the only eventI still considerto be bonkers beyond beliefis the Marathon des Sables",0
1,And that'sonly becauseeveryone knowsthat Scots melt in the desert,0
1,My personal theory for the rise of the extreme sports isthat life has becomesterile,0
1,The chances ofreally getting an adrenaline rush in day-to-day lifeis minimal,0
1,people search out waysto re-engage with life,0
0,"Aftercompleting two Ironman events,I can testifythat the feeling ofsweeping down the finish chute after 140.6 miles topumping pop music,flashing lights and a cheering crowdis the ultimate buzz",2
0,"finishing a marathon, in an empty car park, in the dark, in the pouring rain,is easily its equal for an overwhelming inner sense of achievement",2
0,The other personal joyI get from training for eventsis the quiet time,2
1,Althoughmodern life is humdrum,0
1,it is noisy,0
0,"even a three-mile run gives me the chanceto clear my head, breathe cold fresh air and feel the wind on my skin",2
0,Within 10 minutes ofbeginning a runmy head is clear,2
0,I am calm,2
0,I am reset,2
1,The side benefit of all this training (and probably the reasonthat most people start) is health,0
1,"Ifyou run, cycle or swim youlose weight and feel more vital for it",0
1,"You are fitter, stronger and sleep more soundly",0
1,"You are fit for life - the kid climbing on your shoulders, the run for the bus",0
1,evenjust climbingthe stairs become infinitely more manageable,0
1,It also sets a great example,0
0,my three-year-old has now collected finisher's medals at Ironkids and Loch Ness Marathon and lovesbeing outside,2
0,becausethat'swhatmummy and daddy do,2
1,The increase in demand cannot be satisfied,0
1,A new event seemsto spring up every day,0
1,"No longer restricted by a single Ironman distanceyou can do double, triple or even (for the proper enthusiasts) deca Ironman",0
1,"You can run the 268 frostbitten, British-winter miles of the Spine Race",0
1,You can even get teargassed in the Tough Mudder,0

0,former San Francisco mayor and current lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom is running for governor,2
0,attorney general Kamala Harris gunning for Boxer's soon-to-be- vacated seat,2
1,Whydoes it matter?,0
1,There's certainly something compelling about Harris' daring bid for US Senate,0
0,there are only one in five senators are female in this Congress,2
0,there are only two black Senators currently (Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tim Scott from South Carolina),2
1,Harris won,0
1,"she not only would contribute to the growing number of women in power,buthaving three actual black senators at one timewould make history",0
1,"because,to date, two is the bestwe've been ableto achieve as a nation",0
0,"In America's entire history,only eight black people have ever been senators",2
4,"of those, only half were actually elected, rather than appointed",2
4,"Yet African-Americans make up about 13% of the population, according to the 2013 census",2
1,True proportional representation would see black senators in the double digits in Congress,0
1,California has outsized importance in the US economy,0
4,"on its own, it is the world's eighth-largest economy, just behind booming Brazil but ahead of Russia and Italy",2
1,California's contributions are one of the chief reasonsthe US remains the world's biggest economy,0
1,a black woman is poisedto be one of the most nationally influential politicians in the state,0
1,"California's internal public policy tussles - and its standard more-liberal- than-the-nation solutions - often help lead the rest of the nation and the world forward, be it on pollution standards, minimum wage increases, medical marijuana legalization, organic produce certification, healthcare access for the uninsured, public-private technology innovation such as iHubs and tax breaksthat encourage local production of zero-emission Teslas,same sex marriage and wetlands protections such as the CA Coastal Act of 1976",0
1,"California's politicians can bring to Washington the abilityto combine strong, safe regulatory experience with a booming economy and environmental protections,offering a compelling counter-point to Republicanswho argue otherwise",0
1," with the exception of Jerry Brown's first stint as governor from 1975-1983, California internal top politics has been tendedto be dominated by southern California figures like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger",0
1,Harris (and Newsom) are both northern California people through and through,0
1,"Instead of Hollywood values and priorities holding sway in the state, northern California's tech-powered financial and cultural strength may finally have a chanceto drive the state's politics",0
1,"whileBoxer, her fellow senator Dianne Feinstein and House minority leader Nancy Pelosi all hail from northern California,they spend much of their time in Washington DC ",0
1,Harris's move to DC will provide us with a new generation of representatives steeped in the area's emerging tech-focused culture,0
1,WhileI believeCalifornia has muchto gain from politicians like Newsom and Harris,0
1,who see their work as largely cooperative and people-focused- as opposed to the ideological culture warriorswho normally represent us in national policy debates,0
1,- there's a long road ahead for each,0
1,"Harris, for instance, may haveto contend with billionaire Tom Steyer and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in a Democratic primary (andVillaraigosa would make history of his own)",0
1,But Harris is likelyto have a lot of supportbehind her and ,0
1,"being young,at 50 -a run now forSenate still leavesthe door opento run for governor 10 or 20 years down the road",0
1, stranger things have happened in CA politics,0
0,who would have thoughtthat B-list actor Ronald Reagan would rise from Californiato become the GOP's iconic president,2
0,"that Jerry Brown, now 76-years-old, would become governor again after over 30 years?",2

1,Policymakers have been fretting over the future challenges posed by our ageing population for decades,0
1,Now this time has arrived,0
1,there's nothing there in the way of provision for it,0
1,"Care for elderly people is one of those thingsthat's not hardto sort out, given money,and almost impossibleto sort out without it",0
1,"It's one of those thingsthat, in theory, offers choice-staying at home with support, moving into sheltered accommodation, going into residential care",0
1,"In reality, however, people are so terrified of the prospect ofbeing in a positionwherethey haveto make such choicesthat they'd rather not think about it at all",0
1,One knows vaguelythat there aren't many decent alternatives,0
1,staying at homebecomes the one thingthat is comforting,0
1,Being close to the pastmatterswhenthe present and the future feel like a horrible staging-post before death,0
1,It doesn't helpthat there's so much sentimentality around the issue,0

1,it would hurt little old ladies living in big housesthat had been their homes for decades,0
1," actually, Klass was describing somethingthat isn't necessarilythat desirable: an elderly person living in a homeshe can no longer heat,clean or look after, the neighboursshe once knew long gone,clinging to the past instead of living in and enjoying the present",0
1,"One of the great paradoxes of old age isthat, at a time in lifewhenchange is very dynamic and hasto be managed a lot,people are persuadedthat tryingto stop time,instead of moving forward and adapting to circumstances,is the right thingto do",0
1,"Care at home is pushed as the thingto aspire to, in partbecause -even thoughit's expensive, difficult to organise and not very satisfactory in outcome",0
1,it has the attractive advantage ofneeding no capital investment,0

1,But the limitations of so many of them meanthat the whole concept is sullied,0
1,"Rather thanbeing placeswherenew phases of life are undertaken,they have become placesyou end up inwhenall hope ofenjoying lifeis gone",0
1,It's interestingthat inheritance has become so much an aspect of debate around care for elderly people,0
1,"This, too, is a tacit signalthat you are too oldto spend your own money on yourself",0
1,"At some point, the duty isto hang on to your assets,so that they can be passed on to your family - and without nasty government death taxes",0

1,ifto believethat it was selfishto invest in their own livesjust becausethey are no longer young,0
1,"Elderly people are blocking bedsnotjust becausethey can no longer look after themselves at home,butalso becauseour society is not encouragedto think of elderly lives as valuable and deserving of joy and fun, vitality and change",0
1,Lack of pay is one reasonwhypeople aren't queing upto work with older people,0
1,But another isthat it's not seenas enjoyable,0

1,"Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo",0
1,The culprits appearto have done so in response to the magazine's publication of cartoons deemedoffensiveto Muslims,0

1,It is only by uncritically adopting the hegemonic narrative of western liberalismthat one could reach the conclusionthat the biggest threats to freedom of expression in the world today are Islam and North Korea,0
1,To frame these events without accounting for the broader context and power relationships at workinhibits any sensible understanding of the deep conflicts plaguing our world at present,0
1,Bypositing western liberal claims to freedom against Islam's supposedly intolerant attitude towards irreverent or serious critiques of itwould beto ignore completelythe history underlying the current tensions,0
1,"The reality isthat foras long asthere have been liberal ideals staking their claim to the various freedomswestern societies have cometo sacralise,there have also been societies suffering from exploitation and subjugation at the hands of those professing these lofty principles",0
1,"Even asthey were establishing the very foundations of modern liberal societies, from the tenets of freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion to the basis for democratic forms of governance,Enlightenment thinkers were nearly universal in their expression of support for a world built on racial hierarchies and the expansion of new European empiresthat depended largely on the use of violenceto control colonial subjects",0
1,"That these philosophers developed their racist outlooks towards Jews, Muslims, and blacks on the basis of ""reason"" and ""rationality""makessuch views more abhorrent than thosederived from pre-modern modes of thought",0
1,it is the racist expressions of Enlightenment philosophers or the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo,0
1,these provocative views cannot be separated from the broader political projects at work,0
1,"that western liberalism gave rise to modern states committed to freedom, democracy, and the rule of law",0

1,"Whatis ""radical Islam""?",0
1,Is there such a thing?,0
1,And howdoes this affect the ongoing US-led war on extremism - the most tangible form being ISIL,0
1,who have controlled large segments of land and people in northern Iraq and eastern Syria?,0
1,"Very few people knowthat in Islam there are two kinds of ""jihad""",0
1,The smaller jihad is the more known - namely the onewhich reflects the military struggle,0
1,"But the greater jihad,which is less known,is the internal jihad - or struggle",0
1,"Few people also knowthat the Arabic word ""jihad"" is used throughout the Bible as well",0
1,althoughcertainly not in the militaristic sense,0
5,"2 Timothy 4:7 states:""I have fought the good fight,I have finished the race,I have kept the faith.""",2
1,"The verse in Arabic usesthe term ""jihad"" for the word ""fight""",0
1,"whetherit is this struggle or the fight for a better world,the militaristic jihad is certainly not a monopoly for Islamists",0
1,World leaders have correctly pointed outthat the fight against ISIL must be waged both on the military and ideological levels,0
1,But we must be careful about the idea ofconflating Islam with radicalism,0
2,People and ideas might be radical,2
1,to target a religion with radicalismadds insult to injury and shifts from the proper focuswhich is the individually created extremism,0
1,We have heard and seen a lot of the former,0
1,very little has been doneto tackle the ideologies behind this extreme group,0
1,The needto deal with the extreme thoughts connected to this movementwas made clear by extremistswho carried out the heinous attack against a French satirical newspaper; most likelybecauseof the ideas it has espoused,0
2,"Wheneverviolent acts take place,the natural response isto militarily obliterate the group or militia behind it",2
1,There might be a good case for a military response,0
1,it would be a totally counterproductive effort,0
1,it is not accompanied by an equally strong ideological response,0
1,It might be possibleto kill the holders of some of these ideas,0
2,everyone knowsthat you can't kill ideas byusing force,2
1,Extremist ideology must be tackled in a number of ways,0
1,The most important ideological response to extremism is the needto showthat there are better and more effective ways to deal with the various issuesthat makeextremism popular,0
1,This includes the needto introduce real political reform in the countriesthat are of importance to the peoplethat follow these extreme leaders,0
1,It applies both to the Arab countries,0
1,whose autocratic leadership has left a large sector of the public without any say inwhathappens to them,0
1,But it also applies to the needto continuestemming racism and Islamophobia from many of the western countries,0
1,wheresome homegrown terrorism seemsto be gaining strength,0
1,The issue is complicated by murderous acts like those committed in Paris,0
1,which tendto increase rather than decrease anti-Islamic sentiments,0
1,"In addition to political changesthat must be introduced,Arab and Muslim intellectuals and leaders must end their self-imposed silence and speak out clearly and unabashedly",0
1,There is no reasonto keeprepeatingthat these actions are not a reflection of true Islam,0
1,Whatis neededis for writers and thinkersto produce concrete and practical thoughts and ideasthat can be applicable to the 21st century,0
1,Today's Arab and Muslim youth needto find alternative role models and alternative ideasthat they can adopt in this struggle of ideasthat extremists are working tirelesslyto defend- and towhich the other side is only paying lip service,0
0,"One successful idea calledtakween (seen on the local Jordanian website, ammannet.net) has seen an increase in audience",2
1,"reformed independent writers from various backgrounds (culture, media, women's issues and workers rights) are producing daily analysisthat is the anti-thesis to ISIL's ideology",0

1,"According to a study by researchers at King's College London, many doctors are failingto tackle their patients' weight problems",0
4,Researchers analysed the records of several thousand obese patients and foundthat 80% of them had never talked to their GP about their weight,2
0,"This finding comes in the same weekasit was reportedthat diabetes, an obesity-related disease, is using up a tenth of the NHS budget and causing record numbers of complications",2
0,is fat a medical issue?,2
0,Should nurses and GPs like me broach the subject?,2
0,And does intervention ever work?,2
1,Some arguethat obesity is a symptom of povertyand should be tackled at source,0
1,"whilegovernment, schools and other agencies clearly have a roleto play",0
1,I don't seehowGPs can ignore obesitywhenfaced with it,0
1,"There is no doubtthat the 22% of men and 24% of women in the UKwho are obeseare at increased risk of several cancers, heart, liver and respiratory disease, dementia and diabetes",0
0,"As a busy GP faced with an overflowing waiting room of ill people, it's temptingto avoidbringing up the subject",2
0,I haveto pickthe right moment and phrase itsensitively,2
1,"""Do you feelyour weight is an issue?""and ""Is there somethingwe can doto help?""are good openers",0
1,there needsto be timeto have the discussion,0
0,I admitI often put it off,2
1," arguably, one obese person referredforlife-changing bariatric surgery is a more useful intervention thanseeing a room full of people with coughs and colds",0
1,Not everyone is receptive,0
0,"Some say""I'm overweightbutI am fitter than most people my age""",2
0,"Or ""I know lots of thin peoplewho have died young and fat peoplewho are fine""",2
1,But these comments are the same as anecdotal tales of smokerswho live to 100 and young non-smokerswho die of lung cancer,0
2,"We are talking about increased risk, not a guaranteed death sentenceifyou're obese or smoke and certainimmortality ifyou're thinor a non-smoker",2
2,This sounds obvious,2
1,it's funnyhowirrational many people are,0
1,especially ifyou're telling them somethingthey don't wantto hear,0
1,I thinkGPs have a responsibilityto initiate a conversation about obesity,0
1,it is clearthat it is an important health risk,0
1,overweight people often underestimate their weight,0
1,losing weight can reduce that risk,0
1,there are interventionsthat can help,0
4," bariatric surgery,which is arguably the most effective way ofkeeping weight off,may cut the risk ofdeveloping type 2 diabetes by 80%",2
1,We also owe it to the next generationto intervene,0
1,Most fat children have fat parents,0
1,most will become fat adults in turn,0
4,"More than half of obese six- year-oldswill become obese adults, compared with less than 10% of non-obese kids",2
4,"having an obese parentdoubles your risk ofbeing an obese adult,even ifyou're a skinny child",2
1,So any interventionthat helps a parentto tackle their obesityis likelyto have a positive impact on the adults of the future,0
1,There is no need for doctorsto be nihilistic and thinkit's not worthbroaching the subjectbecausenothing can be done,0
1,"True, we don't know the most effective way oftackling obesity yet",0
1,Europe-wide trials are ongoingto tryto find outwhatthat would be,0
0,But there are options available: local council-run exercise programmes; referral to an NHS dietician; the prescription drug orlistat; or referral for bariatric surgery,2
0,"Last month, a new anti-obesity drug, Mysimba, was approved by the European Medicines Agency, and is likelyto be available on prescription later this year,despite the reservations of some experts",2
1,There will be some GP consultationsin which discussion about obesity just isn't appropriate or relevant,0
1,"a person is devastated by a recent bereavement, for instance",0
2,"it may be rude, crass, insensitive and offensiveto mention their weight",2
1,"having discussed the subject,there is no needto bang on about it at every visit",0

0,"Whenthe predecessor magazine to Charlie Hebdo once mocked the death of Charles de Gaulle,the French government shut it down -- permanently",2
1,"The theory of anti-hate speech laws isthat hate speech often leads to violence,andviolence demands police and thus the expenditure of public resources,and sothe government can makeit illegalto spout hatredin orderto conserve its resources",0
1,"This attitude presumes,asWilson didwhenhe prosecuted folks forpublicly singing German songs during World War I,that the government is the origin of free speechand can lawfully limit the speechit hates and fears",0
1,"It also presumesthat all ideas are equal,andnone is worthy of hatred",0
1,"Whenthe massacres occurred last week in Paris,all three of the murderers knewthat the police would be unarmedandsowould be their victims",0
1,It wasas ifthey were shooting fish in a barrel,0
1,WhyThe answer lies in the same mentalitythat believesit can eradicate hate byregulating speech,0
1,"That mentality demandsthat government have a monopoly on violence, even violence against evil",0
1,"So, to thosewho embrace this dreadful theory,the great loss in Paris last week was not human life,which is a gift from God",0
1,"it was free speech,which is a gift from the state",0
1,"Hence the French government,which seemsnot to care about innocent life, instead ofaddressing these massacres as crimes against innocent people,proclaimed the massacres crimes against the freedom of speech",0
1,"Would the French government have reacted similarlyifthe murderers had killed workers at an ammunition factory, instead of at a satirical magazine?",0
1,howhypocritical was it of the French governmentto claimit defends free speech!,0
0,"In France, you can go to jailifyou publicly express hatred for a groupwhose membersmay be defined generally by characteristics of birth,such as gender, age, race, place of origin or religion",2
1,You can also go to jail forusing speechto defy the government,0
0,"This past weekend, millions of folks in France wore buttons and headbandsthat proclaimed in French:""I am Charlie Hebdo.""",2
0,"Thosewhose buttonsproclaimed""I am not Charlie Hebdo""were asked by the policeto remove them",2
0,"Thosewho wore buttonsthat proclaimed, either satirically or hatefully,""I am Kouachi""were arrested",2
1,Arrested for speech at a march in support of free speech?,0
1,Yes,0
1,What'sgoing on here?,0
1,"What'sgoing on in France,andwhatmight be the future in America,is the government defending the speechwith which it agreesand punishing the speechwith which it disagrees",0
1,"What'sgoing onis the assault by some in radical Islam not on speech, but on vulnerable innocents in their everyday livesin orderto intimidate their governments",0
0,"What'sgoing onis the deployment of 90,000 French troopsto catch and kill three murderers",2
1,becausethe government does not trust the local policeto useguns to keep the streets safe or private persons to use gunsto defend their own lives,0
1,Whydo some in radical Islam kill innocents in the Westin orderto affect the policies of Western governments?,0
1,"Might it bebecausethe fruitless Western invasion of Iraq killed 650,000 persons,most of whom were innocent civilians?",0
1,Mightit bebecausethat invasion brought al-Qaida to the regionand spawned ISIS?,0
1,Might it bebecauseObama has killed more innocent civilians in the Middle East with his dronesthanwere killed by the planes in the U.S  on 9/11?,0
1,"Might it bebecauseour spies are listening to us, rather than to thosewho pose real dangers?",0
1,Whatdoes all this haveto do with freedom of speech?,0
1,Nothing --unlessyou believe the French government,0
1,We are luckyto have today's Germany,0
0,WhenChancellor Merkel arrived in London last week,2
1,she came as the accomplished leader of Europe's most successful liberal democracy,0
1,Germany's economic strength is taken forgranted,0
1,we also takeforgrantedthat this is an essentially good country,0
1,It is not goingto assuage any demons bybehaving aggressively to its neighbours or blaming foreigners for any of its problems,0
1,"It is quietly and determinedly goingto attemptto anchor Europe in the same successful combination of liberal democracy, social solidarity and productive capitalismthat it enjoys",0
1,it has the economic and moral wherewithalto do just that,0
1,This very new country -afterall German reunification was completed just 25 years ago- could be so different,0
1,It could have a poisonous political movement aimingto restore Napoleonic glories riding high in the polls - see the Front National in France,0
1,"It could be captured by venal, vested-interest groupslocking the economy in permanent stagnation like Italy",0
1,It could be in thrall to a know-nothing political rightwhose objectiveisto run the country in the interests of its top 1% like the US's Republicans,0
1,It could be led by a self-regarding nationalist such as Russia's Mr Putin,0
1,"It could live in a cultural time-warp like today's Britain, hankeringto restore the lost certainties of the 1950s",0
1,Germany is none of those things,0
1,it were,0
1,Europe would be fundamentally and worryingly unstable,0
1, this is a firmly liberal democratic country looking forward in the 21st century,0
5,"becauseits relationship to history,asdirector of the British Museum Neil MacGregor argues in his revelatory and illuminating book Germany,compelsit never to look back",2
1,"Germany can only face its otherwise unintelligible historical crimes, genocide and futile millions of war dead with a resolveto never again make the same mistakes",0
1,"Its capital city, Berlin, forces its citizens every dayto confront the factthat it exterminated six million Jews in its striking Holocaust memorial",0
1,no other world capital so uncompromisingly has built monuments at its heartto forceit constantly to confront past disasters,0
1,"Whatdoes it meanto beus is a questionevery country asks,searching its historyto reproducewhatever successit might have once enjoyed",0
5,"MacGregor's argument isthat becauseGermany cannot take comfort or define itself by imagined past glories,it is free of imprisoning and destructive myths",2
1,"It has become, of necessity, a force for good, too little recognised in Britain in part",0
1,becausewe still define ourselves as a victor over Germanywhenit was evil,0
0,Angela Merkel choseto spend some hours of her time inLondon visiting the Germany exhibition at the British Museum,2
0,an exhibition MacGregor has curated alongside his book,2
5,"MacGregor believesBritain does not understand today's Germany, the complexitiesthat delivered itorwhyit thinksasit does",2
1,Merkel agrees,0
1,The point of her British trip was notto devise ways ofhelpingCameron win his EU referendum in 2017,0
1,about which she was stubbornly reticent,0
1,It was very publiclyto endorse MacGregor's view of today's Germanybeforehis exhibition closeslater this month - and perhaps trigger a different debate,0
0,"MacGregor organises the exhibitionso that the first big quoteyou seeisGoethe and Schiller's 1796 declaration: ""Germany?Whereis it?/ I do not knowwhereto find such a country.""",2
0,There are eight different maps of ever-mutating German territory since 1500,2
1,"Thus the home of Immanuel Kant, its greatest philosopher, is Kalingrad (then Konigsberg)",0
2,which is now in Russia,2
0,"the citythat most influencedits greatest poet (Goethe), Strasbourg, is now in France",2
1,"From 1500 to 1806, ""German-ness"" expressed itself through the loose association of principalities, cities, dukedoms and minor statesthat was the shifting boundaries of the Holy Roman Empireuntil its defeat by Napoleon",0
0,Then came the nation statethat wasfirst imperial,2
0,then Hitler's Germany,2
0,"Postwar division followed defeat, then reunification",2
1,"For Germany, the nation state has been an aberrant, destructive interlude between the Holy Roman Empire and now the European Union - a 21st-century variant of the Holy Roman Empire, but with a single currency, market and trading rules",0
1,"For Germany, it is the only wayto conceive of the future, and create a peaceful and productive Europe",0
1,"Senior German officials talk privately in these terms, categoriesthat bewilder the British still locked in fundamentally traditional political categories",0
1,"For its neighbours, one downside of Germany's recent past - 1920s hyperinflation - is its quasi-religious attachment to sound money and budgetary rectitude",0
1,"But the greater German attachment, trumping everything, isto think and build forwardrecognising today's realities",0
1,Thus the Greek political crisis - and the possible confrontation between Germany and the anti-austerity Greek leftifit wins the elections- may have a happier outcomethanthe British consensus could ever imagine,0
1,Syriza has the 30 super-rich Greek familiesthat pay no tax and run Greece as a payola for their own interests in its sights as muchasit is targeting Greece's suffocating external debt burden and excess of austerity,0
1,It is also keenly awarethat abandoning the euro for the drachmaanddetaching itself from the EU exposes Greece to both huge inflation and the tender mercies of Turkey,0
1,The potential deal with Germany is clear,0
1,"The left will forge a proper liberal Greek democracy with the 30 families paying tax,secure the forgiveness of much of its external debt but stay in the euro",0
1,the price will bethat it continues with tough constraints on public spending,0
1,France is shaken to its core by recent events,0
1,Germany will wantto see the atrocities as the acts of a murderous cult fuelled by marginalisation rather than join in any putative clash of civilisations,0
1,It knows better than any other European countrywherethat leads,0
1,"whyit will successfully handle its own backlash against Islam, Pegida",0
1,there is a British referendum on EU membership,0
1,Germany will offer whatever British government the deal necessaryto keep Britain in,0
1,"Its mission isto tryto hold Europe together,keeping at bay the temptations of Islamophobia, nativism, political extremism and protectionism",0
2,It may not succeed,2
1,But imagineifit did not tryorifGermany itself gave in to the same temptations,0
1,"It would loveBritain to recallthat at different times it has fought alongside Germans,to drop its fixation with two world wars and now make common causeto build a great future",0
1,Europe would be so much stronger,0
1,we dared,0
1,Nigeria is at war,0
0,"In the past week alone the Islamist militants Boko Haram have slain hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people across north-eastern Nigeria, some with the help of child suicide bombers, including a 10-year-old girl",2
0,"In recent months they have sacked entire towns and villages, and are now masters over 20,000 square miles of territory",2
4,"About 1.7 million people now liveinBoko Haram's declared""caliphate""",2
4,1.5 million have been displaced from their homes as a result of the violence,2
1,"With a monthto go before presidential elections,Africa's most populous country is losing the war against a fullblown Islamist insurgency",0
1,So whatis the Nigerian government doing about it?,0
0,"In 2013 President Goodluck Jonathan,who is up for re-election,declared war on Boko Haram and dispatched the Nigerian armyto battle them",2
0,But Boko Haram not only fended off the army's offensive,2
1,it ended upbeing emboldened by the obvious ineptitude of the Nigerian forces,0
1,"Soldiers meantto be protecting cities and townshave sometimes taken to their heelswhenBoko Haram's fighters arrived on the scene,leaving inhabitants at the mercy of the Islamists",0
1,But the problem isn'tthat Nigerian soldiers are cowardly,0
1,"it isthat they are woefully under-equipped, under-trained and far too demotivatedto tackle the well-armed Boko Haram fighters",0
5,"The governor of Borno, the state most affected by Boko Haram, has publicly statedthat the Islamists are much better armed than the soldiers",2
1,The reasonthe Nigerian army is in such poor shapeis simple,0
0,"The military's annual budget exceeds ?4bn, but rather than equip and train frontline troops,there are complaintsthat much of the funds end up in senior officers' pockets",2
1,"Soldierswho complainhave been knownto be court-martialed and sentenced to death for ""mutiny""",0
1,"As commander-in-chief, this iswhereJonathan could have been expectedto step in",0
1,But rather thanconfront the army top brassthe Nigerian president has optedto bury his head in the sand and place the blame for Boko Haram's success on everyone bar himself,0
0,"Whennews emerged last year of the kidnap of the Chibok girls, instead ofreacting swiftlyJonathan hesitated for two weeks,suggestingthere was no kidnap, only a plot by his political opponentsto discredit him",2
1,"At other times he has shrugged off Boko Haram's deadly attacksaslittle more than the unavoidable localised version of global jihad, implying with his tone and body languagethat hundreds of citizens getting killed every week is something Nigerianswill simply haveto get usedto",0
0,"Aftera deadly bomb blast killed more than 100 people in the capital Abuja last year,Jonathan was pictured dancing away at a political rally the next day",2
0,"Travelling around the country over the past few weeks,my impression isthat Nigerians are increasingly looking to the main opposition presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, a former general and one-time military ruler, as the country's best hope oftackling Boko Haram",2
1,"Under ""normal"" conditions Buhari, a conservative Muslim from the northwho ruled Nigeria with an iron fist from 1983-85,would have little hope of support in the country's southern, predominantly Christian region",0
0,"Without outstanding charisma, eloquence or competence on policy detail, the 72-year-old Buhari has already made three unsuccessful bids for president",2
1,"But after a yearin which Boko Haram and government corruption has dominated local headlines,the ex-general has two things going for him: a reputation for strong leadership and incorruptibility",0
1,He is probably the only prominent Nigerian politician todaywho isn't hounded by allegations ofembezzling public funds,0
1,A president with military experienceto take on corrupt army officerswould surely serve as a morale booster to the Nigerian soldiers battling Boko Haram,0
1,the ex-general has no magic wandto makethe militants simply vanish,0
1,"But in this period of existential crisis, Nigeria may need a wartime leaderwho can project reassuring strength and provide a plausible strategy forovercoming the insecurity in the country",0
1,Time is running out,0
1,"With two hostage crises playing out in parallel, one given an especially sinister dimension by the targeting of a kosher supermarket, today's pictures from Paris underlined a jihadi threatthat is ugly and real",0
0,"Beforethe standoffs reached their bloody climax,it was reportedthat one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen had trained with militants in Yemen",2
0,A link had also emerged between these two brothers and the police-killer behind the supermarket siege,2
1,in which several hostages are thoughtdead,0
2,Islamist terrorists may be rare,2
2,nobodywho cares for peace or freedomcan doubt the duty on the stateto disrupt such menacing networks,2
1,"Against this backdrop,the head of MI5 is boundto command attention",0
0,on Thursday night Andrew Parker gave a speech about rising threats to British security,2
0,He pointed with justified pride to disrupted plots,2
0,"He stressed, too,that there could be no guaranteethat every attack would be averted",2
1,To have pretended otherwisewould have been wrong,0
1,"But Mr Parker is also, in his way, a political player, well awarethat spelling outhowa UK attack was ""highly likely""will strengthen his hand in the ongoing push for powers",0
1,And he used the attentionthat he had grabbed in this wayto make a disingenuous case for the sort ofsnoopingwhose exposure by Edward Snowden in 2013caused outrage around the world,0
1,The director-general whispered sweet reason,0
0,"He emphasised the oversightthe agency faces, and rejected,he said,the lazy insistence that more security hadto mean less privacy",2
1,The tone was good,0
1,it was the substancethat was wanting,0
5,"He explainedhowdecrypted emails of extremists had been usedto foil one major airline plot,andhowinformation was forensically recovered from a second bunch of fanatics, bent onblowing up London landmarks, after their arrest",2
1,"Such pinpointed(andlegally controlled)intelligence work might, perhaps, also have made a difference in Paris",0
1,whereboth the Charlie Hebdo murderers were on watchlists,0
1,"Mr Parker, however, lurched fromdetailing such targeted work tomaking oblique allusions to the entirely sweeping, and until 2013 entirely unacknowledged, probing of communication records, and the interference with internet trafficon the often-spurious pretextthat it is ""international"" in a purely technical sense",0
1,These are the practicesthat give the state such chilling potentialto keep exhaustive tabs on so many citizens,0
1,"But the effect of Mr Parker's intervention isto kick back against necessary reforms, and to pile on the pressureto put these controversial practices on to a permanent footing",0
1,"As for the oversight he gave such weight to,its weakness was evident today",0
0,"the chair of the intelligence and security committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, uncritically echoed virtually everythingthat he had said,blithelyassertingthat it wasn't the intelligence agencies' jobto spy on ordinary people",2
1,as ifthe Snowden revelations had never happened,0
1,Britain is still crying out for a debatethat the security services continueto duck,0
1,The dreadful events of Paris do not change that position at all,0
1,The longest and biggest oil boom in history is over,0
1,In a boom - andthe latest one lasted almost 10 years-everything shines for producer nations,0
0,the economy grows,2
0,consumption explodes,2
1,businesses make fat profits regardless of their productivity,0
1,poverty declineseven ifsocial protection programmes are ineffective,0
1,politicians are popular and getre-electedeven ifthey are incompetent and corrupt,0
1,people tendto be happier,0
1,oil prices tendto be cyclical,0
1,"whenthe downturn comes,the party ends",0
0,"During the oil price decline of the 1980s, most oil-dependent countries suffered the consequences of the resulting collapse in investment and consumption",2
0,"A few, such as Oman and Malaysia, were ableto compensate for the price collapse by increasing production",2
1,"many oil exporters suffered,alsodue to the production cuts agreed by Opec",0
1,Some recovered better than others,0
1,in general between 1982 and 2002 they fared much more poorly than the rest of the developing world,0
1,Thosethat fared worstwere typically the onesthat got into debt during the boom,0
1,Poverty and unemployment rose sharply,0
1, such underperformance led to the widespread ideathat having oilis a curse,0
0,which has generated extensive literature,2
1,The reality is more complex,0
1,asshown by economic overperformance during the past decade's boom,0
1,"taking out those two ""bust"" decades,oil countries have outperformed their peers over the past 70 years",0
1,"So the real ""curse"" is in fact an oil price collapse",0
1,"The current price collapse - for the first timesince2009 prices are below the symbolic $50 a barrel- is largely a result of the boom in shale oil production in the US, adding more than 3m barrels over the past few years",0
1,High prices bring investment and supply,0
1,this boom was no different,0
1,Oil prices are notoriously difficultto predict,0
1,we do not knowifthe current bust will last,0
1,despite evidence prices are still above historical standards,0
4,For the majority of the more than 120 years of history of the oil industry the price has been below $50 in today's money,2
1,But geopolitics or renewed consumption could alter the oversupply scenario and surprise us once again,0
1, oil busts tendto leadto booms down the road preciselybecauseinvestment in oil exploration dries up,0
1,"Net importers, like most European countries, will benefit from the oil price decline",0
0,"In the US, citizens will pay significantly less for gasolinethanthey haveover the past five years",2
1,leadingthem to spend more on other goods,0
1,A vast transfer of wealth from exporters to importers is occurring,0
1,the fall is short term,0
1,some pain will be suffered by all net oil exporters,0
1,it will only be disastrous for the countriesthat failedto learn the lessons of the previous boom and bust cycle,0
1,"This time around many countries have saved a larger part of their windfall and invested more in productive assets, although generally significantly less than the value of the resource being depleted",0
1,Many abandoned their conservative fiscal policies during the financial crisis of 2008-09,0
1,which made sense,0
1,they never got back to the prudence of the first few years of the boom,0
1,Middle Eastern producers were promptedto increase spending by the unrest produced by the Arab Spring,0
1," with few exceptions, most exporters are in better shapeto weather the storm",0
1,"The wealthy countries of the Gulf, and some of the Caspian countries, can easily manage a temporary fall in prices ",0
1,they have accumulated large external funds,0
1,some face more worrisomelong- term fiscal prospects,0
1,Even Russia is in a better positionto manage the oil fallthanthe Soviet Union was,0
1,it would still suffer from the necessary cuts in imports and spending,0
1,the sanctions will hurt more,0
1,Iran is in worse shape,0
1,becauseit had a less prudent economic policy,0
1,sanctions had already produced a crisis even before the fall in the oil price,0
1,"Nigeria, despite an improved macro policy in comparison with the previous boom, is goingto be significantly affecteddue to its excessive dependence on oil",0
1,leading to an increase in poverty and political instability,0
1,Angola is also vulnerable,0
1,"Latin American oil exporters with generally prudent macro policies, like Colombia and Mexico, will also be affected by the necessary fiscal adjustment",0
1,they should be ableto manage it with limited trauma,0
1," no country is in worse shape entering into the price collapse than my home country, Venezuela",0
0,"As the proverbial grasshopper of the fable, Venezuela did not only spend throughout the summer, mostly in consumption",2
1,it also went into a debt bingeto afford even more consumption,0
4,the country was running deficits of 15%-20% of GDP during the peak boom years,2
1,Now comes the winter,0
1,it faces economic collapse,0
4,Inflation could top 100% in 2015,2
1,shortages are widespread,0
1,"there is a high probabilitythat many Venezuelanswho came out of poverty during the boomwill fall back into it, with serious consequences for political stability",0
1,Oil abundance is not necessarily a curse,0
1,Most producers are better prepared this time around,0
1,"for the fewthat learned nothing from the past,the reality will be as harsh as the grasshoppers' winter",0
1,"President Obama's plan, announced Friday,to make community college free for promising students,will be seen by some as a game-changer",0
5,"the president noted in his speech,his proposal --""America's College Promise""-- is based on Gov  Bill Haslam's Tennessee Promise program",2
0,which offers free tuition to students attending two years of community or technical college,2
1,the president's plan will certainly makecommunity college accessible to many more students,0
1,it is also far from clearthat such students will benefit,0
1,"Despitethe president's best intentions -- absent serious reform -- pressuring community collegesto improve outcomes,graduation rates have no reasonto rise",0
1,directing more students to community colleges withoutstudents will become eligible for two free years of tuition,0
1,"they maintain merelya 2.5 GPA, hardly stellar in this age of rampant grade inflation--the president's planmight, perversely, worsen graduation rates",0
5,"To that end, the president insiststhat participating schools will needto ""adopt promising and evidence-based institutional reformsto improve student outcomes.""",2
1, the success of his proposal depends ondemanding a greater degree of accountability from community colleges,0
1,thoughit's not exactly clearwhatsuch reforms might entail,0
1,"Regardless ofhowit all turns outModd-NU,the president's proposal will not solve the larger problems facing American higher education, namely, ever-rising college tuition and student debt",0
1," despite his pledgeto ""[help] every Americanlarge federal subsidies for community colleges might exacerbate such problems",0
1,"Flush with new funding,community colleges might, for instance, be temptedto imitate their 4-year peers and increase spending on administrators, frivolous capital projects, and other extravagant amenities",0
1,"Tuition hikes would, in turn, invariably follow--the brunt ofwhich would be borne by students ineligible for the new federal subsidies",0
1,"Yet under the Obama plan, even many newly subsidized students would likely not escape unscathed",0
4,"At present, nearly 60 percent of community college students do not finish their degrees within 6 years of enrolling",2
1,"As such, it's likelythat newly subsidized students--many of whom will not graduate over the course of their two year subsidies--would inevitably needto worry about tuition increases as well",0
1,more American families and students question the value of a college degree,0
1,it's essential--asthe president rightly does--to emphasizethat college graduates outperform their non-degree holding peers on a wide range of outcomes,0
1, policymakers would be wiseto findways to maximize the value of students' tuition dollars,0
1,"Alas, simply enabling more studentsto attend college, withoutcreating the right incentivesto ensure better outcomes,is not one of them",0
1,The first thingto say about the collapse of Circle's pioneering contractto manage Hinchingbrooke district hospital in Cambridgeshireisthat it must be desperately worrying for patients and staff alike,0
1,"Even thoughthe Care Quality Commission foundthat the hospital was ""inadequate"" across the board, including care and safety",0
1,which probably precipitated Circle's decisionto pull out,0
2,- uncertainty alliedwithill health is a terrible combination,2
1,"NHS England, and the Department of Health, have a heavy burden of responsibility over the coming daysto restore confidence and clarifywhathappens next",0
1,The second point isthat it is a political catastrophe for the Conservatives ,0
0,althoughthe process of privatisation began on Labour's watch,2
1,- all the worse forcoinciding with evergrimmer news onwaiting times at accident and emergency departments in England,0
1,The cost and disruption of the Lansley reforms must bear some responsibility for the worst winter crisis ever,0
1,Hinchingbrooke's failure surely torpedoes any immediate prospects of a big expansion of privatisation,0
1,"It looks like a clear victory for all thosewho have repeatedly warnedthat privatisation and profits are incompatible with a free, universal healthcare system",0
1,"It could be Tweeted as Goldman Sachs (training ground of Ali Parsa, Circle's former chief executive), nil, NHS, one",0
1,The truth is more complex,0
1,Circle won the contract in a process of franchising out Hinchingbrooke hospital management at leastpartly becauseno NHS bidder thoughtthe sums could be madeto add up,0
1,"Hinchingbrooke,which sits almost equidistant between major hospitals in Cambridge to the south and Peterborough to the north,is a hospitalthat has needed downsizing or even closing for the last 20 years",0
1,"Now Circle is pulling out,less than a third of the way through a 10-year contract, reportedly?7m poorer and with a stock pricethat has taken a double-digit hit in the past 24 hours,surely confirmationthat privatisation delivers no magical solution",0
1,"Circle's obligations includedpaying down a debt of?40m, accrued over just three years, within the next 10",0
1,The heroic scale of that commitment was laid bare in a National Audit Office report in 2013,0
5,which showedthat Circle would haveto deliver?30m of savings every year,2
0,"Only months after the start of the contract in February 2012, it was clearthe hospital was well behind its savings target",2
1,Althoughcare improved,0
1,it was clearthe financial plan wasn't working,0
0,Mr Parsa stood down as chief executive of Circle,2
0,"By the end of its second financial year, the deficit was just short of ?5m, the pointat which Circle could pull out",2
0,MPs on the public accounts committee have questionedhowthe contract cameto be awarded at all,2
1,Part of the answer isthat it was clearan NHS solution was not on the cards,0
1,it would have taken more cashthanwas available post-crash,0
1,But there's a lesson in the waycontracts are awarded too,0
1,At least one study suggestsa lack of expertise in Whitehall meansthat contracts go to the shiniest rather than the most competent contender,0
5,Circle complainsthat it wasn't in control of the environmentin which it worked,2
1,"Like every hospital trust, it struggled under new treatment tariffs,the Nicholson challenge to make?20bn of savings over a five-year period, and fluctuating demand influenced partly by GP and community care availability",0
1,"The Lansley reforms have set up a competitive relationship between the new carecommissioning groups and providers such as Hinchingbrooke, unforeseenwhenthe contract was agreed",0
1,"The process ofwinding up the Circle franchise and bringing the hospital back into NHS managementwill laybare the weaknesses of the new structures, the lack of any proper local accountability and the inabilityto reorganise services on a coherent, holistic basis",0
1,"The impact of complexity, centralisation and cost-cutting are now graven on the statistics",0
4,"The figures published today showthat every aspect of A&E; care - not just waiting times, but delayed ambulances, ambulances waitingto transfer patients,and patients waitingto be transferred out of A&E;- are the worst on record",2
1,The Conservative vision for the future of the NHS is looking like an electoral liability,0
0,"On 20 September 1943, my great uncle Alex found for the first and last time in his lifethat the smartsfor which he would always be renowned in his familywere no longer enough",2
0,he was arrested in Nice and sent to the death camps,2
1,Alex knewwhatawaited him there,0
0,his older brother Jakob had done this journey already and died in Auschwitz a year before,2
0,"So he dug up the floorboards of the train with his stubby fingers, slipped through the hole, lay on the trackwhilethe train rattled over himand walked back to Paris, hidden along the way by communists",2
0,He then joined the Resistance,2
1,he never trusted France again,0
0,"In later life, he gave back the Legion d'Honneurhe was awarded for his war service after Charles de Gaulle described Jews in 1967 as ""elite, domineering and sure of themselves""",2
1,Are you tired of Holocaust stories?,0
3,"Apologies forbringing up all that ""unpleasantness"" again",1
0,I've been thinking about Alex this week,2
4,"According to a YouGov poll,45% of Britons agreed with at least one antisemitic statement put to them, such as ""Jews chase money more than other people"" (endorsed by a whopping 25%),and""Jews' loyalty to Israel makesthem less loyal to Britain than other Britons"" (20",2
1,"I feel less certain about another survey this week, by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, conducted on social media",0
4,which claimedthat 54% of British Jews feelthey have no future in the UK,2
1,But the tenacity of antisemitic beliefs is striking even in Britain,0
4,"where,according to a separate report last year by Jewish Policy Research, 47% of the British Jewish respondents feltantisemitism was not a very big problem",2
4,40% didfeel antisemitism had increased in the past five years),2
1,This would have astonished Alex,0
1,He adored Britain,0
0,he had been in Britain as part of the Free Frenchbeforehe was captured,2
0,he often spoke about the comforthe gotlistening to the BBC World Service during his fighting days,2
1,I imagineit will astonish most Britons too,0
1,"eventhosewho, in a dark and unacknowledged place inside, instinctively agree with the statementsposed by YouGov",0
1,You don't haveto travel too farto find them in the UK,0
1, you can just turn on the BBC,0
5,"One Jewish woman, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, told BBC reporter Tim Wilcox this weekthat the horrific murder of four people in a kosher supermarket made her worry about the return of Jewish persecution",2
5,"""Many critics, though, of Israel's policy would suggestthat the Palestinians sufferhugely at Jewish handsaswell,"" Wilcox said",2
1,"- all but saying: ""So swings and roundabouts, really.""",0
0,"Wilcox later apologised on Twitter for a ""poorly phrased"" question",2
1,as thoughthe problem here was one of grammar,0
5,"Only two months previously this same reporter, in an on-air discussion about Miliband losing Jewish support, said:""A lot of these prominent Jewish faces will be very much against the political mansion tax, presumably.""",2
1,They most certainly will!,0
1,You knowwhatthose Jews are like,0
1,"always watching their massive pile of shekels, with their prominent faces and their prominent noses",0
1,"Now we turn to Paris,wherethe terrible events of last week would not have surprisedAlex nearly as much",0
1,"There were an astonishing number of attacks on Jews and synagogues in France last year, with the resultthat twice as many Jews emigrated to Israel in 2014 than the year before",0
1,Since the awful killings there has been plenty of talk from the media and politicians abouthowwe all mustn't letthis atrocity give rise to an anti- Muslim backlash,0
1,This is right and good,0
1,"But can we takea few minutes to lookat the lash itself, as well as dealing with the backlash?",0
0,Four Jewish people were killedbecausethey were in a Jewish supermarket,2
1,"this inconvenient truth has been relatively littleremarked upon, certainly compared with the angsting over the parameters of free speech at Charlie Hebdo, or commentary about the irony of the terrorists killing a fellow Muslim, the police officer Ahmed Merabet",0
1,Is this because killingJews is seen as par for the coursewhenit comes to terrorist attacks?,0
1,Becausethat doesseemto be true,0
0,"Going back to the attacks in Mumbai in 2008,the killers specifically sought out a Jewish community, Nariman House, and tortured and killed six Jews, including the Rabbi and his wife",2
1,The Taj Hotel has become the symbol of the Mumbai attacks,0
1,"according to some reports, it was actually Nariman Housethat was the terrorists' main target",0
1,"Already the killer of the Jewish people in the supermarket is being referred to, incorrectly, as ""the Charlie Hebdo killer""",0
1,So just par for the course?Maybe,0
1,but I don't thinkthat's quitewhat'shappening here,0
1,"Jews are, as the YouGov report madevery clear,seen as a pretty dominant people",0
1,"in charge of the media, you know",0
1,And Hollywood too,0
1,"Elite, domineering and sure of themselves",0
1,"whenthey are attacked,there is a sensethat - well,they kinda brought this on themselves",0
1,there are other groupsthat are less elitethat need more looking after,0
1,I'm not surewhythis is an either/or situation,0
1,A person can be horrified by anti-Muslim prejudice and also terrified by the attacks on Jews,0
1,to talk about oneis not an endorsement of the other,0
1,For a BBC reporterto balance the killing of Jews in Paris against the atrocities in Palestineis the definition of idiocy,0
1,"Not as bad asexpressing outright sympathy with the killer of the Jews, as the reliably idiotic ""comedian""Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala did on Facebook,but still bad",0
1,"This is not the victim Olympics, with only one possible ""winner""",0
2,"These were peoplewho were killed,not political statements",2
0,My great uncle Alex led a wonderful life after the war as an art dealer,2
1,he never again trusted the countrythat had betrayed him so badly,0
5,"WhenI asked oncewhyhe refusedto keep his paintings in a bank vault,preferring insteadto keepthem hidden in his house,he replied:""Because they always come for the Jews.""",2
1,Plus ca change,0
1,Has there ever been so much debate about a debate?,0
1,"The negotiations about this year's TV leader's debates sank to a new low last week, with David Cameron appearingto use the factthat the Greens now look likelyto be excluded as an opportunityto bow out",0
1,"Far from a principled stance, this came across as a self-serving attemptto get out of jail free,followingasit did in the wake of his equivocation aboutwhetherhe would participate in the debateshe once so enthusiastically embraced as challengerrather than incumbent",0
1,Cameron's decisionto pull out of an online video debate for first-time votersalso reflects poorly on his motives,0
1,he really wantedthe Greens involved,0
1,he would have co-ordinated a call from all three party leaders to the broadcastersto include them in the debates?,0
1,In the face of such cross-party consensus it would have been unthinkableforthem to refuse,0
1,It is a damning indictmentthat the political parties cannot even agree on a format for a series of election debates,0
1,One hasto questionwherethat leavesthe real challenges facing the countrythat will require a degree of cross-party consensus to tackle over the next decade,0
1,in a timewhenincreasing political instability looks setto be the norm,0
1,Long-term reform of the NHS and care systemsto cope with an ageing population or restructuring the banksto insulate us against another financial crisisare issues far more complex and thorny than a debate format,0
1,This episode reveals two further truths,0
1, all our leaders have claimedto wantto change the nature of the conversation between politicians and voters,0
1,But too often these claims are undermined,0
1,"Ed Miliband argued for a new politics in July 2014,shunning the shallowness of husky-themed photo-ops",0
1,"He launched his election campaign with a promiseLabour activists will engage in four million conversations,talking to people on doorsteps rather than communicatingusing poster campaigns",0
1,"But the authenticity of this has been undercut by Labour's continued reliance on negative campaigning, including their election broadcast ridiculing Nick Clegg as the ""Un-Credible Shrinking Man""who has abandoned his principles, and leaked strategy documentstelling candidatesto move onwhenvoters raise immigration as an issue",0
1,Cameron's attemptto extract himself from debatesthat attracted tens of millions of viewers in the run-up to the last electionundermines these claims by the political class even further,0
1,It smacks of politicians only interested inpursuing a new style of politicswhenit suits their strategy,0
1, the disagreement around the debates is a symptom of the extentto which Britain's two-party majoritarian system is breaking down,0
1,The vote share of the two main parties has steadily declined in recent decades to the extentthat it no longer looksas ifthe two parties will be ableto sustain a majority under the current electoral system,0
1,We are now in the territorywheretheir declining vote share means first pastthe post is beginningto deliverwhatincreasingly looks like arbitrary rather than democratically credible outcomes,0
1,It is nonsensical for the Greensto be excluded on the basis of their vote share in an electoral systemthat providesstrong disincentives to vote for them in the first place,0
0,Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition for themto be included,2
4,eight in 10 voters thinkthey should take part,2
1,"Ofcom's decisionthat they don't have sufficient supportto accord them ""major party status"" and the broadcasters' reluctanceto invitethem to participatehave the ring of a political establishment desperately tryingto cling on to the cartel-like status quo",0
1,"A political rulebookthat better reflects the more pluralistic politicsdeveloping in Britainwould do more than any speech or campaignto facilitate a more honest, authentic conversation with the public",0
1,Cameron's attemptto wriggle out of the debatesis shameful,0
1,"he must accept the invitation issued by the Guardian, Telegraph and YouTubeto take part in an online debate including the Greens",0
1,But he should be doing much more,0
1,he should be leading a national conversation involving all the party leaders abouthowthe pluralism of the electorate can be represented in a more democratic system of politics,0
1,"The longerthe main parties tryto resist,the more disillusioned and disenfranchised the public will become",0
1,Muslims - in theory - have traditionsthat value the power of the pen,0
1,Islam was revealedto save people from bloodshed and misuse of the sword,0
0,"That is a paraphrasing of the cardinal's line in one of the Acts of Edward Bulwer-Lytton 1839 play ""Richelieu""",2
1,"The origin of the timeless adage is thoughtto have originated in Assyrian wisdom - like Islam, moral and value systems of Middle Eastern descent",0
1," the moral, intellectual and ethical systems of that region - including those carried through dialogue with Hellenic ideas in the first three centuries of Islam - have all been subjected to obscurantist and literalist interpretations of revelation",0
1,"Islam's first command to the Prophet Muhammad wasto ""read""",0
5,"""Read in the name of thy Lord.""",2
0,"Chapter 68 in the Quran is named ""Al-Qalam"" (the pen)",2
5,"It opens up with the verse:""By the pen and what they inscribe.""",2
0,In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen,2
5,"""Who taught by the pen.Taught mankind thatwhich he knew not""(96:4-5)",2
1,So it should be natural for Muslims todayto feel total empathy towards fellow writers and journalists and the families of other victims in France,0
1,Especially in solidarity against the cowardly slaying of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and cartoonists,0
1,"Reading and writingbelong to the ""genus"" of cross-disciplinary activitiesIslam insists upon repeatedly",0
1,"Reading,writing and reasoning are all part and parcel of the way of lifeIslam is all about",0
5,"In Chapter 55 we find ""Allah - Most Gracious!It is HeWho has taught the Quran.He has created man.He has taughthim eloquence [intelligence]"" (55:1-4)",2
1,"The didactic ethos of numerous Quranic injunctions on the pen,knowing and reasoning,seemto be lost today in the heap of ignorance and obscurantismthat is consuming many a Muslim land",0
1,"Landswherescholars of Islam underwrite political power at the expense of freedomof speech and a rational interpreting of the Quranthat delivers Muslims from the yoke of oppressionthat is consuming Muslim youthand pleads the case of social justice, freedom of thought and tolerance",0
1,"The sad state of the violence that today engulfsMuslim cities, pitting Muslim against Muslim, is in no small measure the result of the over-politicisation and over-securitisation of Islam",0
1,Whole states are disintegrating,0
1,religious and sectarian intolerance is ushering in a horrible era of annihilation and self-destruction,0
1,Islam never began with jihad (a holy war),0
1,"The miracle of the Prophet Muhammad isthat he knewwhento retreat(via Hijra or emigration) to build values of solidarity, peaceful coexistence with all kinds of ""otherness"" (such as in Medina and hostile Arab tribes), create know-how, and voluntarism in faith and membership of community, along with moderation (""wasatiyya"")",0
0,"Quran is the word for ""reading""",2
1,"Those Muslimswho, in cold blood, killed French journalists and cartoonists,supposedly to ""avenge the prophet""miss the point about the prophet's ways",0
5,"That includes the injunctions that ""Verily, this Quran guides [human beings] to thatwhich is most just""(17:9),and""Ifanyone took a lifeunlessit be for murder andspreading injustice in the land,it would beas ifhe killed mankind entirely"" (5:32)",2
1,"Satire, criticism, and cartoons will never caricature the grand stature of the prophet nor diminish the sacredness of the Quran to Muslims and billions of tolerant human beingswho share countries, ideologies or friendships with hundreds of millions of Muslims",0
1,Denigration comes from the savagery of heinous violence,0
1,Manichean ways many self-professed learned scholars of Islam or self-serving politicians knowingly and unknowingly are pushingtrusting Muslim youth and entire nations towards the abyss,0
1,"France has historically accommodated millions of Muslimswho fled poverty, marginalisation and even oppression",0
1,Many of those come from North Africa,0
1,"Maghreb countries have benefited not only from remittances, but also from a vast shared spacein which Muslims, Christians and Jews have learnt the art of toleration of differences",0
1,Whatthe murder of innocents in Paris has doneis inflame inter-communal trust,0
1,"like the 9/11 attacks in the US 14 years ago, it has placed Muslims in the awkward position ofbeing either unwelcome among host communities or defending Islam",0
1,"This is because of the insane acts of co-religionistswhose Islamis fixated on the ""sword"" and has littleto do with the might of the ""pen""that over millennia Muslim luminaries usedto connect with others, and spread knowledge",0
5,"In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo murders, Ahmed Merabet's brother Malek correctly declared:""My brother was Muslimandhe was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims",2
5,...Islam is a religion of peace and love,2
5,As farasmy brother's death is concernedit was a waste,2
5,"He was very proud of the name Ahmed Merabet, proudto represent the policeand ofdefending the values of the republic - liberty, equality, fraternity.""",2
0,"Asthe new edition of Charlie Hebdo hits the stands with another cartoon cover depicting a weeping Prophet Muhammad under the heading""All is forgiven""",2
1,a critical question must be asked,0
1,Whom are we poking fun at?,0
1,The terrorists or Muslims in general?,0
1,Howcan we use the prophet as the signpostto make fun of the terrorists,0
0,"Lassana Bathily, a young Muslim immigrant from Mali, saved a whole group in the kosher supermarket and provided police with the key toending the hostage crisis at the store",2
1,Could it bethat his inspiration and values are informed by the example of the prophet,0
1,did we askhowhe feels about the new cartoon and dowe careto listen to the answer?,0
1,"Who is being forgiven - the prophet, the terrorists or Muslimswho believe in Islam and rightly hold the prophet in high esteem?",0
1,"Byframing the response with the prophet cartoon,Charlie Hebdo is echoing CEO Rupert Murdoch's tweetthat all Muslims ""must be heldresponsible""for the Paris attack",0
5,"President Francois Hollande in a ceremony honouring the three fallen police officers appropriately expressed the sentiments of many stating,""France is at war against terrorism, jihadism, radicalism.France is not at war against Islam and Muslims""",2
1, Charlie Hebdo's new cover will complicate matters further and in a short period will sideline many Muslims at a critical time in this global struggle against terrorism,0
1,Charlie Hebdo and the press have the rightto publishwhatthey like,0
1,but Muslims are freeto be offended bywhatis published,0
1,it is their rightto be critical of such depictions,0
1,No one should tell Muslimswhatthey should or shouldn't get offended by,0
1,asit is up to themto determine it for their community,0
1,"Bydepicting the prophet in a cartoon drawing,Charlie Hebdo chose racism and Islamophobic discourse against all Muslims",0
1,"This action transformed the discussion from one focused on terrorism, jihadism and murder into a narrow theological and legal debate concerningwhatcan and can't be represented in images about the prophet",0
1,This is an issue involving all Muslims not only the terrorists,0
1,Another wasted opportunityto build on unity and bring Muslims into the global fold,0
1,Charlie Hebdo's editors choseto stay in the mud of racism and Islamophobia,0
1,Some arguedthat they had no choice,0
1,they neededto stay true towho they are byprinting such a cartoon,0
1,however this would be even morethe case that the terrorist forced the subject of the cover rather than the other way around,0
1,"Freedom of the press proponents will celebrate the release of the new cover and view it as a triumph over terrorism byinsulting all Muslims through another racist cartoon depicting the prophet,as a hooked-nose Arab looking man",0
1,Let's be clearthat the overwhelming majority of Muslims will continueto uphold their traditionthat it is impermissibleto represent the prophet's likeness in the form of an image,0
1,whilecertainly few had the opinion in the pastthat it is not prohibited,0
1,This will not change anytime soon,0
1,it is none of anyone's business other than Muslimsto decide on this matter,0
1,Charlie Hebdo's cartoon attemptedto bring the prophet into the debate around terrorism and Muslim violence,0
1,which in my view is a shortsighted strategyto deal with a most serious problem,0
1,"Byselecting the prophet as the site of contestation,Charlie Hebdo took a page from the clash of civilisation advocates and built a cartoon narrative around it",0
1,Indoingsothey joined the coalition with the global Islamophobic industry and neo-conservative networkthat have been pushing this framing for almost 30 years and for sure since the collapse of the Soviet Union,0
1,We are in agreementthat the terrorists claimedto act on behalf of Islam,0
5,asMalek Merabet statedhis brother likewise is a Muslimand defended the newspaper from an ethical and moral ground,2
1,that I fully believeare informed and grounded in Islam,0
1,"Indecidingto print the new cover poking fun of the prophet's image,Charlie Hebdo sided with the terrorist framing of Islam and not with the Muslim police officerwho lost his lifedefending themand would have been likewise offended by the new publication",0
1,I dobelievethat ifAhmad Merabet were alive todayhe would still show up at the newspaper,0
1,to protectthe individuals and their freedom to insult his faithwhiledeeply aggrieved by it,0
1,"In this context, every timethat we make the connections between terrorism and Islamwe are only validating the terrorist's own epistemic and pushing the 99.99 percent of the Muslims away byinsisting to insult the prophet and through it their faith",0
2,One can have the freedomto say and do something whileunderstanding the painthat it causes othersifit is actually carried out,2
1,Today would have been a great dayto have a cartoon of Ahmed smiling at the terrorist while defending the newspaper and the cartoonists in the name of his Islam,0
1,This is not giving into the terrorist but standing with Muslims inopposing terrorismand byaffirming the painand sufferingthey experienced as a result of the heinous crime committed in their name,0
1,"Yet on a deeper level, the terrorist purportingto speak for Islamis a crime in itself",0
1,which for many Muslims would be akin toaccepting the KKK claimsto be the authentic voice of Christianity,0
1,"Byframing the response to the terrorist through an explicit link to Islam,we are granting them the credentialsthey wantand directing more attention to their cause",0
1,The proper response should have beento remove their Islamic claims and celebrate and embrace the real Muslim heroes,0
1,who defended and protected lives at both the Charlie Hebdo offices and the shoppers at the kosher supermarket,0
1,Who are we poking fun at?,0
1,The Muslimsasdiverse minorities in France living at the margins of society are the object of the satire,0
1,not the powerful or the terrorists,0
1,It is not the powerful but the powerlessthat is the object of the laughter,0
1,Freedom of speech is not absolute,0
1,responsibilities are attached to it and more sowhenthose living at the margins are subject to racism and discrimination,0
1,"We should defend free speechbutdoingso whilelistening to the voice of the voiceless living in our midstanddying for ""our"" collective rightto insult their faith",0

0,"Days after the US military sentsix clearedGuantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay,these were some of the images published as part of a photo essay on December 14 in the Miami Herald",2
1,The piece illustrated a vivid picture of human resilience after over a decade of extreme privation and suffering,0
1,"Asinspirationalasthey were,the photographs also servedasa stark contrast to the daily realities experienced by the former inmates during the course of their detention",0
1,realities still experienced by the 127 men still heldthere,0
1,"On Guantanamo's 13th anniversary, the US government must continueto work diligently without any more excusesto ensure due process for the remaining detainees and shut down one of the darkest holdovers from the ""war on terror""",0
5,"In a joint declaration issued last year by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, several other UN agencies and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the US was urgedto ""adopt all legislative, administrative, judicial, and any other types of measures necessary to prosecute, with full respect for the right to due process, the individuals being held at Guantanamo Naval Base or,whereapplicable,to provide for their immediate release or transfer to a third country""",2
4,"Yet, of the total of 779 men and boysthat have been detained at Guantanamo Bay since 2002,only nine have been convicted of any crime",2
4,"Of the 127 remaining detainees, 59 have been unanimously cleared by US intelligence and security agencies, of any involvement in terrorism but continueto await their release",2
4,"The remaining 68 inmates are classified as ""indefinite detainees"", a Kafka-esque category used for detainees ineligible for either trial or release",2
1,"These men will face Periodic Review Board hearings, an incipient interagency processthat will assesswhetheran inmate poses a threat to the US or is eligible for transfer",0
1, this procedure lacks guarantees to due process and will likely prolong situations of arbitrary detention,0
1,"asinmate transfers continue,the US must abide by the principle of ""non-refoulement"",ensuring detainees' rightto not be returned to a placewherethey will face persecution, torture or death",0
0,This guarantee was not upheld withcleared inmate and Centre for Justice and International Law and Centre for Constitutional Rights' client Djamel Ameziane,2
0,who was forcibly repatriated back to his birth country of Algeria despite stated fears of persecutionand standing precautionary measures ordered in his favour,2
0,"Upon his return, Ameziane was detained by Algerian government agents as part of an ""evaluation process"" and subjected to abusesthat left him in poor health",2
1,Ameziane's forcible repatriation is only one of several other cases,0
0,"In 2014,two other men were involuntarily repatriated to Libya",2
0,"in 2007, two others were sent back to Tunisia",2
1,"Resettling detainees back to countriesthat will expose them and their families to threats, persecution, and - in the case of detaineeswho are not cleared- to ongoing detention and torture,will only deepen years of suffering and injustice",0
1,"The US Senate committee's grisly report on the CIA's interrogation methods and the trickling repatriation of cleared inmates represent important steps towardsmaking the truth of the ""war on terror"" available to the public",0
1,"However, the question overhowmaterial and intellectual authors of torture will be held accountable in accordance with international lawremains",0
2,"As party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the US is not only forbidden from practising torture but requiredto prevent and hold accountable any individualswho are involved in these particular kinds of human rights violations",2

1," under the Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention - the articlewhich barstorture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment against prisoners of war - the US could be held accountable for war crimes",0
2,"under international law, amnesty laws are not permittedandthe authors of torture must be prosecuted - at home or abroad",2
1,The public availability of documentationto establish the truth behind Guantanamo Baywill no doubt play a pivotal role indismantling the architecture of state-sanctioned human rights abuses,0
1,the US Senate's scathing report revealed some of the most shocking instances of torture,0
1,"its 6,700 pages are the tip of the iceberg",0
0,"In early December, a US judge ordered the disclosure of over 30 tapesdepicting the controversial nasogastric force-feedings of hunger strikers in Guantanamo,including Abu Wael Dhiab - one of the six men released to Uruguay",2
0,Whileattempts are being made by the Obama administrationto overturn the ruling,2
0,human rights groups continueto demand for release of the tapes,2
1,"Almost six years afterUS President Barack Obama signed an executive orderto shut down Guantanamo Bay,it is unfathomablethat this international symbol for US human rights abuses remains open",0
1,The ongoing reluctanceto punishthose responsible forauthorising and using tortureis even more unfortunate,0
1," now more than ever, the US government can send a powerful message statingthat no one is exempt from international accountability and prosecution",0
1,"Whatis done nowwill startto ensurethat torture - or ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"" - are never used by the US or other military and intelligence personnel in situations of conflict",0
1,the US will finally be ableto close one of the grimmest chapters in its history,0

1,"That the killers' made Jews their additional, parallel targetlends a woefully familiar, disgustingly antisemitic twist to a three-day trail of carnage and grief",0
1,"Byso doing,they hoped yetanother community would be left in fear",0
1,"This attack was thus also an attack on the French nation as a whole, on the values and beliefsthat have sustained it,andon the message of liberty, equality and fraternity it has unevenly but persistently propagated",0
1,its principal victims were irreverent secularists,0
1,it was also an attack on faith - an offence against moral as well as human law,0
1,"It was an attack on the life spiritual itself,whetherconducted through church, mosque, synagogue or personal observanceIt was an act of utter godlessness",0

5,"""These men are criminals...For me, they are not Muslims,""said the imam of Drancy",2

1,whileAssad is still there nominally in power,0
1,a closer look revealsthat he is more marginalised than ever and an increasingly irrelevant political actor on a stage dominated by others,0
1,This authoritarian facade must be taken into account in future policy towards the beleaguered country,0

1,The problem withnot applying the GST to fresh foodisthat rich people aren't paying GST on fresh food,0
4,Taxing the purchase of fresh foodis estimatedto provide an additional $6bn in government revenue each year,2
1,"For a federal government with a revenue problem, it must be infuriating to forego billions from peoplewho can fairly easily affordto pay",0
1,The problem withapplying the GST to fresh foodisthat poor people would be paying GST on fresh food,0
4,"Households in the lowest 20% of income earners pay almost two and a half times more GST, as a percentage of income, than households in the highest 20%",2
1,"For a federal government with a now-cemented reputation for unfairness, it would be foolhardyto make life even more expensive for thosewho can least affordto pay",0
1,"Sure, the government could provide GST relief through compensation payments to low-income people",0
1,such payments are inefficient atmeeting the actual cost of the tax,0
2,They also create another ongoing obligation on the public purse,2
1,"Some people might consider this a political conundrum, but not some of the fearless members of the Abbott government",0
0,"Senators Ian Macdonald and Dean Smith, MP Dan Tehan, and trade minister Andrew Robb are rushing forthto call for changes to the rate and base of the GST,includingapplying the tax to fresh food",2
5,"The father of Australia's GST, John Howard, has opined in recent yearsthat it was a ""pity""Labor did not support the GST on fresh food in 1999",2
1,Now others are stepping forward with proposals,0
1,"Unsurprisingly, business groups wantto increase the GST and decrease company tax",0
1,The Australia Institute has arguedthe government could lessen the regressive impact of the GST byexpanding the baseto include private education and private healthcare-services largely consumed by those on higher incomes ,0
5,which it estimateswould raise an additional $2.3bn a year,2
1,It's an intriguing idea with political appeal,0
1,there are potential budgetary disincentivesifthe tax pushes people off private services back on to free government services,0
1,All this public speculation is leading to the impressionthat the Abbott government does not have control of the GST agenda,0
1,The implications are dreadful for the Coalition,0
1,Just ask Campbell Newman and Mike Bairdhowdelightedthey are to campaign in a climate of GST hypotheticals,0
5,Some conservative commentators have claimedthat all the Abbott government needsto doto stemthe freefall in the polls isto get its messaging right,2
5,"Surely in 2015,they say,a better sales pitch - and a fresh-faced young assistant treasurer in Josh Frydenberg - will turn around the public's opinion of the government and its budget",2
1,Whatthese folks misunderstandisthat good policy makesgood politics and no policy makes terrible politics,0
1,"Right now, the Abbott government has no overarching policy agenda, no coherent narrative, no holistic approach to the nation's current budgetary challenges",0
1," it has surprise measures (reintroduction of fuel indexation), broken promises (cuts to the ABC, health, education and the pension), wild new spending commitments (PPL), counter- productive new taxes (GP co-payment), and random thought-bubbles of the kind currently proffered by minister Robb and co",0
1,Whereto start insolving the problem?,0
1," instead ofpushing a lot of random levers in its budget and hoping some of them work,the government needsto put forward a ""grand bargain"" to the people of Australia",0
1,"fixing our budgetmeanswe needto fix our complicated, inefficient federation",0
1,"We needto work outwho is goingto do what to whom, andwho is goingto pay for it",0
1,"It also meansfixing our tax system, not just tinkering with high-income levies or raising the GST by a couple of per cent",0
1, the federation and tax reform white papers should come out as soon as possible,0
1,"Frankly, these should have come out much, much earlier",0
1,"Whatwere Coalition members doingasthey sat on the Opposition benches waitingto win the ""unloseable election""?",0
1,"Secondly, as part of this ""grand bargain"", the government needsto get real aboutending the age of entitlement",0
1,"Right now, it is just code forpunishing the poor and protecting the rich",0
1,The tax system doesn't just haveto be fair,0
1,it hasto be seento be fair,0
1,Asking the lowest income peopleto pay GST on fresh foodwhilecontinuing to give high-income superannuants and investment-property ownersmassive tax concessions would keepthe age of entitlement alive - for those at the top of the income scales,0
1,"Rather disturbingly, one word seemsto connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm",0
1,"I say disturbingly,becausepointing out some common groundmay be seen asblurring the crucial distinction between murderous bastards and innocent satirists",0
0, it strikesme as fascinatingthat the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion,2
1,"yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasmthat inspiresJews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter thosewhose only weaponwas the pen",0
1,So what'sthe connection?,0
2,In one sense an iconoclast is someonewho refuses the established view of things,2
2,who kicks out against cherished beliefs and institutions,2
1,Which sounds pretty much like Charlie Hebdo,0
1,"But the word iconoclast also describes those religious peoplewho refuse and smash representational images,especially of the divine",0
0,The second of the Ten Commandments prohibits graven images ,2
1,which iswhythere are no pictures of God in Judaism or Islam,0
1,"And theologically speaking, the reasonthey are deeply suspiciousof divine representation isbecausethey fearthat such representations of God might get confused for the real thing",0
1,"The danger,they believe,isthat we might end upoverinvesting in a bad copy, somethingthat looks a lot likewhatwe might think of as god",0
1,"which, in reality, is just a human projection",0
1,So much better thento smash all representations of the divine,0
1,"And yet this, of course, isexactly whatCharlie Hebdo was doing",0
1,"In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insistingthat the images people worship are just human creations - bad and dangerous human creations",0
1,"And intaking the piss out of such images,they actually exist in a tradition of religious iconoclasts going back as far as Abrahamtaking a hammer to his father's statues",0
1,Both are attacks on representations of the divine,0
1,"Which iswhythe terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken inthinkingCharlie Hebdo is the enemy",0
1,"ifGod is fundamentally unrepresentable,then any representation of God is necessarily less than God and thusdeservesto be fullyandfearlessly attacked",0
1,"whatbetter way ofdoing this than through satire,likescribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God",0
1,It's only some Christiansthat might demur from this logic,0
0,For the Christian story (ie Christmas) tells of God coming into the world as a human being,2
1,And indoing thisthe divine takes on a representational form,0
5,"Jesus,says St Paul,is the image of the invisible God",2
1,Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable,0
1,So I can seehowsome Christians might finddisrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting,0
1, they believeit's possible for images genuinelyto capture something of God,0
1,images can't capture God- andthat's the Jewish/Islamic position- then bring on the cartoonists,0
1,They should be encouragedto do their worst and disrupt our confidencethat whatwe think of as Godbears any resemblance to anything legitimately God-like,0
1,They are like Moses bringing down the golden calf,0
1,It is the ancient job of the iconoclast,0
1," of course, these terrorists weren't really interested in theology",0
1,"They thoughtthat Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribethey called fellow Muslims",0
1,And maybe they were,0
1,"whateverelse was happening,it was the atheist cartoonistswho were performing the religious functionand the apparently believing Muslimswho had forgotten their deepest religious insights",0
1,For any representation of the divinethat leads people to murdereach other deserves the maximum possible disrespect,0

1,Historians play a vital role inmeasuring presidents,0
1,Usually their histories are written decades after the fact,0
1,they can go back and review documents and gather facts and see the results of presidential actions from afar and in a cold dissected view,0

1,You pulled our troops out of Iraq and Afghanistanbeforethe job was done,0

1,you'd go for the ambulance,0
1,you might actually need an ambulance,0
1,I absolutely can't think of a simpler way ofdescribing it,0
1,It seemsthat NHS 111 works slightly differently from NHS Direct,0
1,which preceded itand was staffed by nurses,0
0,in that very few of the peoplewho answer the phoneare medically trained,2
1,They have no more chance offixing a human body themselvesthansomeone in an EE call centre has ofgenerating a 3G signal using an alkaline battery and a radio transmitter,0
0,They work off a computer system called Pathways,2
0,"which tells themwhat questionsto askand then,the answers having been typed in,whatadvice to give",2
1,"Astriage goes,this is flawed",0
1,"The first stage of it - the decisionto opt for 111 rather than, on the one hand, 999 or, on the other, a paracetamol and a lie-down- is conducted by the patients themselves",0
1,This ensuresthat the new service gets a nice mix of thosewho are definitely dyingbut don't wantto be any trouble and malingererswho are losing the courage of their convictions,0
1,Then the next stage is a sort of medical version of those magazine surveysthat claimto tell youwhetheryou're romantic or sociopathicor spiritual or a typical Scorpio,0
1," regardless ofwhethermost of your answers are As, Bs or Cs,the system still just advisesyou to consult someone trainedto diagnosewhetherthere's anything really wrong with you,rather than waste any more time describing your nasty rash to a guywhose last jobwas cold-calling about missold PPIs",0
1,"that'swhatcauses the trouble for A&E;: the combination of a risk-averse computer algorithm, call centre staffwho don't want blood on their hands and the scarcity of GP appointments on public holidays, weekendsandwhenthere's good skiingto be had,is driving thousands of 111 callers into A&E;to be put on a trolley and ignored like a rum baba in a 70s restaurant",0
1,The solution is simple,0
1,the algorithm needs some backbone,0
1,Bywhich I don't meanthat the decisions should be taken by actual live vertebrates- that's obviously unworkably expensive,0

0,January 15 marks a decadesinceMahmoud Abbas became the Palestinian president,2
1,"during which timethe goalshe claimsto espouse not only remainunrealised, but are more remote than ever",0
0,He is still in office despite his term ending six years ago; the democratic processthat brought him to power no longer in existence,2
1,He speaks of his people's human rights,0
1,whilehis Palestinian Authority actively curtails them,0
1,He claimsto champion their national rights whilecollaborating unconditionally with the countrythat denies them,0
1,"Abbas' image as a hapless, harmless figure deflects from the cunning and ruthlessness of someonewhose primary concern, like the Middle East's other autocrats,seemsto be his longevity",0
1,The factthat he plays ball with the West and Israelsomehow makesthis okay,0
1,Whereother Arab strongmen nurture an image of powerto maintain it,0
1,he relies onbeing seen as an underdog,0
1,"But this illusion,which has traditionally served Abbas well,no longer extends to his people",0
1,"Many think heandthe PA serve their own interests and those of Israel, rather than those of the Palestinians",0
4,"According to a poll last month, 55 percent believethat the PA has become ""a burden on the Palestinian people""",2
4,"Regarding the presidency, Abbas has consistently lagged in opinion polls behind his Fatah colleague, Marwan Barghouti",2
4,"Since Israel's last Gaza invasion, he also runs behind Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh",2
1,"Is it mere coincidence, then,that Abbas has been lacklustre incampaigning for Barghouti's release from Israeli jail; or inpursuing and implementing national unity deals with Hamasthat call for elections?",0
1,"Since the signing of the latest reconciliation agreement in April, Abbas has at various times threatenedto end it,and has been openly adversarial towards Hamas",0
0,Electionsthat were due within six monthsnever happened,2
1,he remains unchallenged,0
1,this has gonelargely unnoticed,0
1,The PA -which is meantto safeguard Palestinian rights- serially abuses them,0
5,"Human Rights Watch has documented ""police beatings and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators"", ""excessive force"", ""repressing critical news reporting and demonstrations"", ""suppressing dissenting views"", and ""serious rights abuses, including credible allegations of torture""",2
5,"for which ""no security officials were convicted""",2
1,"As such, the PA is not only failingto curb Israeli abuses,but is busyperpetrating its own, all under Abbas' watch",0
1,The PA has garnered a reputation among Palestinians formanaging the occupation rather than strivingto end it,0
1,"One way it doesthis is ""security coordination"" with Israel",0
0,"which Abbas described last year as ""sacred"" despite the vast majority of Palestiniansopposing it",2
1,"Such coordination serves Israel byenablingit to subcontract its occupation,and serves the PA byhelpingit suppress internal dissent",0
1,It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people,0
0,"Abbas and his foreign minister have made grotesque assurancesthat as long ashe is president,he will not allow an uprising against Israel",2
1,"So the PA,which is supposedto be part of a national liberation struggle,is willingto put down an uprising by its own people against their subjugation",0
1,This is nothing short of betrayal,0
1,"For more than 20 years, the PA has participated in a ""peace process""that has greatly entrenched Israeli control",0
0,Abbas himself was an architect of the disastrous Oslo Accords,2
1,The occupied territories are now so colonised and fragmentedthat a viable Palestinian state is widely consideredimpossible,0
1," Abbas still wantsto negotiate,despite Israel being clearly opposed to Palestinian self-determination",0
1,"What,then, is the point ofnegotiating?",0
1,"Perhapsto preserve the privileged elitesto which the PA and the ""peace process"" gave birth",0
1," allegations of corruption and nepotism, including Abbas and his family, are nothing new",0
1,"With the help of international aid, the PA is the largest employer of Palestinians, much like other autocraciesthat encourage public dependence on the stateto avoid mass unrest",0
1,A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel,0
0,"He opposes armed resistance, and has gone to great lengthsto disarm militants in the West Bank",2
0," he also opposes peaceful forms of resistance, including the increasingly effective Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement",2
1," it took the PA more than two years since Palestine's upgraded UN statusto applyto join the International Criminal Court,despite repeated threatsto do so amid constant Israeli provocations",0
1,"That Abbas finally relentedmay not only, or necessarily, be aboutlosing patience with Israel,but aboutassuaging mounting Palestinian anger at his procrastination inapplying to the ICC",0
0,"Meanwhile, he sayshe will keeppushing for a UN Security Council resolution calling for a deadlineto end Israel's occupation",2
1,despite the certainty of repeated failure by US veto,0
1,Abbas seemsto be attempting a balancing act,0
1,"He wantsto prove to Israel, and his western and Arab backers,that he is their best Palestinian partner,safe in the knowledgethat they will not accept Hamas rule,but mindful notto suffer the same fate as Yasser Arafatoncehe was no longer deemeduseful or reliable",0
1," his recent, uncharacteristic defiance against Israel reflects a needto stop his flagging domestic popularity turning into an uprising against him and the PA",0
1,"Abbas has nothingto show his people after 10 years as president, and at least another decade as part of the ""peace process""",0
1,"He remains in office because of, not despite, Israel's occupation and Palestinian disunity",0

1,The British are the world's worst cowards,0
1,It is one thingto sayyou don't approve of Charlie Hebdo's cartoons,0
1,"But the BBC, Channel 4 and many newspapers won't run any images of Mohammad whatsoever",0
1,They would at least have acknowledged censorship,0
1,they had announcedthat they were frightened of attacks on their staff,0
1,"They would haveclung to a remnant of their honourifthey had said:""We are not censoring out of respect.We loathe the murdererswho enforce their taboos with Kalashnikovs.But we do not wantto spend years living in hiding,asSalman Rushdie did.Or be stabbed in the street,asTheo van Gogh was.Orhear an Islamist smash at our door with an axe and cry:""We will get our revenge,"" -asKurt Westergaard did.So we are backing away.""",0
1,"Admittedly, an honest admissionthat terror workswould shred the pretencethat journalists are fearless speakers of truth to power",0
1,But it would be a small gesture of solidarity,0
1,"It would say to everyone, from Pakistani secularists murdered foropposing theocratic savagery,to British parents worried sickthat their boys will join Islamic State,that radical Islam is a real fascistic force",0
1," most journalists have lived a lie for years,ashave many in the arts, academia and comedy",0
1,"We take on the powerful - and askyou to admire our bravery-if,and only if, the powerful are not a paramilitary forcethat may kill us",0

5,"He hopesthat historians will continueto saythat the Koran was a manmade creation,but doubtsthat journalists will be keento take their work to the public",2
1,This is not a small capitulation,0
0,"In the 19th century, the textual criticism of German scholars revealedthat the supposed word of God in the Bible was a mess of competing stories",2
1,It did as much damage to Christianity and Judaism as Darwinism,0

1,We are equally engaged with all major parties and relevant politicians and administrators in India on this issue,0
1,The fight in Mahan is about the rights of those peoplewho live there and depend on the forest for their livelihoods,0
1,The local community is only askingthat due process is followed,0
2,under Indian law there must be a local referendum and consent from the local community,2
1,these laws have been bypassed,0

1,"they will be joining almost 50% of their peers instudying for a degree, facing average costs of upwards of?46k for a three-year degree, including tuition and living costs, compared with the generous grants available up until the 1990s",0
1,"Setting expansion aside,it is remarkablehow muchhasn't changed: at the heart of the systemremains a core model of young people moving away to universityto study for three-year full-time degrees",0
1,for which they now bear much of the coststhemselves,0
1,Yet the jobs market has changed beyond recognition,0
1,Graduates are now responsible forforging their own careers in a fluid market compared with the jobs for lifethat were the norm a few decades ago,0
1,employers are demanding a completely different set of skills,0
1,"Does this model, then,remain fit for purpose?",0
1,"The political debate has focused on fee levels and headline prices to the exclusion of almost everything else, including the benefits and value of a university education - andhowthey might be improved",0
1,The debate aboutwhetherthe 50% participation target is too highhas been similarly staid,0
1,surely it's a no-brainerto hopethat at least half of young people engage in advanced learning,0
1,But what type of learningshould that be?,0
1,One of the purported benefits ofmarketising higher educationwasthat the market itself would deliver innovation and better value,0
1,But the government massively overegged the potential for higher educationto behave like a market,0
1,Student demand far exceedssupply of places and price has become a proxy for quality,0
1,"Little wonder, then,that average fees are far higher than the?6,000 a yearthat the then universities minister, David Willetts, predicted",0
1,"he introduced the?9,000 fee cap",0
1,We now have the nonsense of a marketwherestudents pay the same for very different amounts and quality of academic provision,0
1,This is reflected in the variation in students' own perceptions,0
4,research by the consumer body Which?found almost a third of first-year undergraduatesthoughttheir course was poor value for money,2
4,less than half thought seminars were worthattending,2
1,There is too little accountability for this variation within the powerful sector,0
1,universities award their own degrees,0
1,the sector is opaque,0
1,even resisting movesto publish comparable information on the amount ofteachingstudents can expect for their fees,0
1,"the higher education regulator is weak, with virtually no powersto telluniversities to buck up standards",0
1,The debate about innovation has centred on distance learning and Moocs (Massive Online Open Courses),0
1,There is no doubtdevelopments in technology have the potentialto transformthe way university education is experienced,0
1,But it's pointlessto focus on technology at the expense of changesthat needto happen in the systemin orderto take advantage of it,0
1,Moocs will not transform the sectoruntilthey are embraced by the most prestigious universities,0
1,"whyshouldn't you be ableto study for a cut-price Oxford degree, half via YouTube and Skype, and half among the dreaming spires?",0
1,Other innovationsthat could bring down costs withoutsacrificing qualitymight be a restructure of the systemto standardise first-year curriculums,0
1,enabling young peopleto combinestudying for a year or two at their local university with a year or two on campus at a more specialist institution,0
1,"We could see more professional degrees co-delivered and funded by universities and employers, such as the accountancy degree offered by Durham and KPMG",0
1,in which young people benefit from six years of combined university and work experience,0
1,"Or there could be more intensive two-year courses, perhaps aimed at young peoplegetting a year or two of work experience after school",0
1,University could be combined with more modern ways ofadjustingto adulthood,0
1,"for example, a year spent in a structured volunteering programme, such as that offered by the charity City Year, offers huge opportunitiesto develop the grit and teamwork so valued by today's employers",0
1,whilemaking a real contribution to schools and other public services,0
1,"But on some measures we are movingbackwards, with a massive fall in numbers of part-time and mature students in the few yearssince the ?9,000 fee cap was introduced",0
1,There are lessons from the 1960s,0
0,"Harold Wilson's government realisedthat the only wayto increase access in the face of a reluctant sectorwasto back Michael Young's vision for a new institution, the Open University",2
4,which increased the student population by Britain by a fifth,2
1,it was launched via its distance learning degrees,0
1,Government can't simply wait for the sectorto dowhatit is askedto do,0
1,"It needsto foster a conversation with universities, students and employers aboutwhatit meansto get a degree",0
1,Of course there will always be a role for the academic,0
1,"But should we be shoehorning the majority of undergraduates into this model, orshouldgettinga degree more routinely encompass work experience?",0
1,It should also introduce strong new accountabilities within the sector,0
1,"One way ofdoing thiswould beto separate degree-awarding powers fromlearning provision,assuggested by the Social Market Foundation",0
1,"This would allow new providersto offer innovative ways ofmeeting the standards set by a Russell Group university, for example",0
1,And government should provide more incentives for universitiesto innovate,0

1,it hardly needspointing outagain that Gordon is no longer fit for purpose,0
1,indeedhe ever was,0
3,But more on his record shortly,1
1,That Taylor should have rifled through his Rolodex of metaphors and alighted on the absolute archetype of victim-blamingin orderto continue obliquely victim-blaming in the Ched Evans case,0
1,"well, perhaps there's a mirthless laughto be had there",0
1,But it would take a stronger stomach than mineto manage it,0
1,"The sadness - or rather, one of many acute and diverse sadnesses - isthat this was a weekin which football was crying out for an intelligent and sensitive advocate,findingitself once more cast in a roleit should never be requiredto occupy in a truly civilised society",0

1,"As for football fans - the great ""them"" of many debates - they have spent the weekbeing cast as too thick and impressionableto be ableto make their own judgments about a convicted rapist",0
1,"Evans could have been nothing but a role model, presumably to the vast tumultwho turn out at Boundary Park each week",0
1,It's as depressingasit is disturbing,0
1,Such toxicity and lunacy have attached themselves to football and its place in our society,0
1,"that thosewho love the sport as well as thosewho playit really need the calm, cool intellect and charm of a Shami Chakrabartito lobby in their real interests and those of the game",0

1,It certainly does,0
1,Except Gordon just couldn't bringhimself to keepit that way,0
0,The next few days were spent with this union leader giving detailed interviews on Gascoigne's mental state and past treatment,2

1,And no round-up of Gordon's greatest hits would be complete without a look at that endlessly intriguing confidentiality dealhe signed with News International,0
0,"which awarded him a?700,000 settlement for phone-hacking in return for his silence",2
5,"Asthe News of the World's lawyers later had it in a letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee,Taylor's lawyers had informed themthat he ""wantedto be vindicated or maderich""",2

1,you might judgehim to be rich already,0

0,"Five years ago, I went on a searchto answer the question:Whatcan people doto have a happy, fulfilling, lifelong marriage?",2

0,I didn't ask psychologists or consult self-help gurus,2
0," I decidedto go to the people with the most experience: older Americanswho have been married 50, 60, 70 years and more(described in my recent book, ""30 Lessons for Loving"" (Hudson Street Press, January 8, 2015)",2
1,I believedthat the view from the finish line of marriage would be uniquely valuable,0
0,I wasn't disappointed,2
1,"America's elders provided a treasure trove of lessons, tips, and advice forhowto find the right mate and keepthe spark alive over decades",0
1,Here are seven thingsthey would like younger peopleto know,0
3,"who are looking for a relationships to thosewho are in oneand strivingto make it last ""as longasyou both shall live.""",1
1,Marriage is hard,0
1,Even thoughthis is not onthe minds of couples gettingengagedor standing at the altar,0
1,the elders wantyou to knowthat marriage is hard,0
1,It's tough - both because of the range of stresses and problemsthat confront all couples,0
1,but also because of the fundamental difficulty ofmerging two separate and different people into one single life,0
0,"I learnedthat they see marriage as a discipline, likebecoming an athlete or a musician",2
1,you never reach perfection,0
1,you are constantly learning,0
1,you sacrifice short-term gain for something more rewarding later on,0
1,But marriage for a lifetime is worth it,0
5,"Being with someone for a half century or more,they told me,is incredibly good",2
1,"It is a sublime experience, a connection to another person unlike any other relationship",0
5,The elders describe it as the experience of a lifetime,2
1,"For peoplewho make it,it even beats the heart-pounding passion offalling in love for the first time",0
1,So making a marriage lastmay be hard,0
1,the elders also wantyoung people to knowthat it's worth the effort,0
1,Whatcan you doto keepthe spark aliveandthe marriage interesting for decades?,0
0,The elders adviseyou to think small,2
1,The view from the end tells youthat a marriage is made up of hundreds of daily interactions,0
1,"In each of those you have a chanceto be positive,to be cheerful,to be supportive",0
1,"They suggestthat you make a habit ofdoing small, positive things",0
0,One ideathat came up oftenis doing your partner's chore,2
1,"Sayit's 6 AM on a cold, rainy morning,the dog is scratching on the bedroom door,andit's your partner's turnto walk him- butyou get up and do it",0
1,That's money in the bank for the relationship,0
1,"Talk, Talk, Talk",0
0,The elders believethat many marital problems can be solved through open communication,2
5,"One manput it colorfully:""Keep yapping at one another.""",2
1,"According to the elders, the strong, silent type may be initially attractive - but probably doesn't make the best marriage partner",0
5,"As one 80-something told me:""Ifyou can't communicate,you're just two dead ducks.""",2
1,Stop tryingto change your partner,0
1,you are getting serious about someone,0
5,",the elders sayyou must accept your partnerasis,or don't get married",2
1,"You should never say to yourself:""Afterwe're married,she or he will loseweight/get a job/like my family/change heart abouthaving kids""-or any other behavior or attitudeyou don't like",0
1," ask yourself:""Can I live with this trait for a lifetime",0
1,makingyour partner a do-it-yourself projectonly leads to anger and disappointment,0
1,Are we hungry?,0
0,Here's onethat surprised me,2
1,a couple is having an argumentthat threatensto become a truly major blow-up,0
0,the elders suggestthat whatyou may needis - a sandwich,2
0,these long-married folks saythat you should never argue on an empty stomach,2
1,Offer your partner somethingto eatwhenhe or she is aboutto fly off the handle,0
1,"According to the elders, rather than a therapist you may sometimes need a pastrami sandwich or a piece of pie",0
1,It's cheaper and more fun!,0
1,you want more wisdom ,0
1,"ask the elders in your own lifewhatMaybe it's inevitable,now that Julian Assange,has spent almost 1,500 days in the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy,that memories ofhowhe cameto be in theregrow ever more hazy",0
1,"With a forgetfulnessthat,ifgenuine,demonstrateshowrapidly the most preposterous inventions can acquire the status of fact",0
1,even his colleagues at WikiLeaks have convinced themselvesthat Assange was incarcerated by a British government determinedto keephim quiet,0
5,"Among the more opportunistic tweets responding to the massacre in Paris,came this,from the WikiLeaks account:""David Cameron pontificates about freedom of speechwhilespending millions detaining #Assange without trial.""",2
1,"At this impressive rate of fabulation, the 2,000th day should see our unhappy visionary gagged in a dripping cell",0
1,he awaits the death sentence applied to all fugitiveswho dare speak freely in the Kafkaesque nightmarethat is 21st- century Britain,0
1,"It would bear as much relation to the facts, after all, as the current myth of his forced detention without trial",0
0,"in June 2012, Assange, founder of WikiLeaks,was in the UK, freeto speak on any subjecthe liked,andfighting extradition from Britain to Sweden,wherehe faced allegations of sexual assaults on two women",2
0,Preferringto break his bail conditions rather than clear his name in Swedenhe sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy,2
0,wherehe remains to this day,2
1,"It is a source of consternation,at least outside his support base,that the cost ofpolicing the embassyso asto enforce the legal processshould Assange everemerge,has now exceeded?9m",0
0,"Last November, an arrest warrant for Assange was upheld in a Swedish court",2
1," #Assange is not ""detained"" by anyone or anything other than his own reluctanceto facequestioning about alleged sex offences, in a countrywhereextradition to the US is no more likelythanit is here",0
1,"But maybe this confusion about his journey from free-speech celebrity to pallid hermit helpsone understandwhyAssange, though accused of sex offences, has survived much of the public opprobrium, internet gossip and suspicionthat dogs other individuals associated with accusations of sexual misconduct, such as the harassment expert Julien Blanc or the Lib Dem octopus, Lord Rennard",0
0,"On the websitewherea petition denounces the footballer and convicted rapist Ched Evans,thousands demand the Nobel prize, along with freedom and protection, for Assange",2
0,"his admirers even attemptedto kickstart funds for a statue,honouring the manwho has portrayed his Swedish accusers as instruments in a smear campaign",2
1,"Other analysts, however, have detected enough evidence of female self-determinationto attribute the women's hostility to everything from sexual jealousy to a bad case of radical feminism",0
1,"Clearly, Assange's better-informed supporters,who include celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Arundhati Roy and Vivienne Westwood,will be aware of the Swedish allegations and have chosen, for one reason or another,to set them aside",0
1,"A similar immunity seemsto have been conferred on Prince Andrew, following allegations of his sexual improprietywith a minorwho worked for his American friend, a convicted paedophile",0
0,"Though""emphatically denied"",with the extra benefit of a character reference from Andrew's ex-wife,who was lent money by the paedophile",2
0,there has been no announcement of the type of legal manoeuvrethat the similarly accusedAlan Dershowitz is pursuing after allegationsthat he also took sexual advantage of the 17-year-old,2
5,"Yet Andrew, too, has so far escaped a petition objecting to him ""assisting the economic success of our United Kingdom"",asthe palace describes his various holidays",2
1,"Perhaps,ashappened to the creepy Blancwhenhe attemptedto visit the UK,some other country would be good enoughto help out with a banning order",0
1,"the difference between unproven allegations and, in Ched Evans's case, a formal conviction, can satisfactorily explain this variability in public tolerance",0
1,"the footballer's supporters are surely entitledto compare his treatment unfavourably with, for example, that of Roman Polanski",0

5,They saidthey were avenging the prophet,2

0,"To have a sense of humouris fine,I told them",2
1,to target an already stigmatised people in Franceis not really showing much courage,0
0,The shootings have been described as an act of war,2
1,I can understandwhysome might characteriseit that way,0
1,But they are wrongto do so,0
1,"isn't thisexactly whatthe violent extremists such as Da'esh, so-called Islamic State, want?",0
1,They wantto saythe west is at war with Islam,0
1,we areto take the action of marginal groups and usethat asevidencethat there is a war between Islam and the west,0
1,aren't we merelyfalling into a trap?,0
1,George Bush fell into that very trap immediately after 9/11 bycalling it the war on terror,0
1,actually he promoted it with his rhetoric,0
1,The mostwe can reasonably say nowisthat we are at war with violent extremists,0
1,they are coming from,0
1,why play that game at all?,0
1,Let's be specific:these are criminals exploiting Islam,0
1,The great majority of the victims are actually Muslim,0
1,There are tensions in many countries,0
1,things have been very difficult of late in France,0
1,Two recently published books reflect the atmosphere: very negative and very demoralising,0
1,The French Suicide by Eric Zemmour expresses the fearthat millions of Muslims might be colonising and transforming the country,0
1,(he is hopingthey will be helpedto leave),0
0,"and Michel Houellebecq's novel Submission,which predictsthat in 2022 an Islamic party will take over France",2
5,"Three years ago, Houellebecq saidIslam was the most stupid religion in the world",2
1,"In the UK, in terms of daily life, the situation is better",0
1,There isn't that feeling of permanent stigmatisation in the discourse,0
1,ashappens in France,0
1,"But even so, things feelas ifthey are changing for the worse",0
1,It is no accidentthat Ukip has been on the rise,0
1,in such a climate one feels the public discourse changing,0
1,There are parties happyto target migrants and to target Muslims,0
1,It's a driftwe haveto stop,0
1,in my view we actually have a shared responsibility,0
1,"Politicians, intellectuals, journalists, Muslims and people of other faiths (or none) must be clear and united about our common principles",0
1,We need politicians with more on their minds thanwinning the next election,0
1,One sees difficult days ahead,0
1,asyesterday's dramatic events in France showed,0
1,"there is the issue of media organisations intent onpublishing the most offensive Charlie Hebdo cartoons, claimingthat it would strike a blow for free speech",0
1,I support free speech,0
1,I would urgethem to desist,0
1,whatthey planto dois not courageousand will do nothingto afford people dignity,0
1,It will be another example oftargeting all Muslims,0
1,"It would saythat ifour fellow Muslim citizens are not part of the equation,we will targetnot the extremists-but Islam itself",0
1,It would hand the extremists a victorythey could scarcely have achieved for themselves,0
1,"In the United States today, the odds ofgetting a degreeare more tightly linked to family income than ever before, thanks to skyrocketing college costs and insufficient and misallocated federal and state financial aid funds",0
4,Althoughthe federal government distributes about $170bn a year in financial aid to many types of students attending many types of schools,2
1,many low-income families still haveto pay too much,0
4,Low-income families often end uppaying about 40% of their family income for a memberto attend community college,2
4,"for four-year colleges, the bill can add up to a whopping 59% of a family's earnings",2
4,Even middle-class families may be askedto spend or borrow a quarter of their annual incometo finance one child's attendance at a public university,2
1,whilethe costs of a private one are yet higher,0
1,"As a result, many families of modest means are unableto afford college",0
1,"Students from middle- and low-income families have also becomemore likelyto drop out from public colleges and universities,leaving with debtsthey can't affordto pay backrather than degrees",0
1,But these are more than just personal tragedies,0
1,they represent a significant loss to America's economy and competitiveness for decadesto come,0
0,"On Friday, President Obama offered a simple, universal solution: free tuition for two years at community colleges for studentswho maintain a 2.5 grade point average, attend at least half-time and make steady progress towardscompleting their program",2
0,The federal government would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college,2
0,participating states would be expectedto pick up the rest,2
1,The last timea president did something this bold on higher educationwas the original Higher Education Act of 1965,0
0,"Then, President Lyndon Johnson had a huge Democratic majority in Congressto support his proposal",2
1,"President Obama, on the other hand, faces a tougher road in a government run by Republicans",0
1,who are reluctantto supportspending more moneyto help poor and middle class people,0
1,yet they should forego partisanship and take this legislation seriously,0
1,Instead ofbeing available only to the poorest students(like Pell grants) free community college tuition would be available for all,0
1,"The most powerful and enduring American social policies -Social Security, infrastructure investments like the highway system and indeed public education itself- have always benefitted everyone",0
1,America's outdated student aid policies simply aren't fulfilling their mission and are instead actively failingto make college affordable for all students,0
1,"And, unlike many other proposalsto fix the twin problems of college affordability and student debt focused on four-year programs,free community college has the potentialto meet the immediate needs of employers",0
1,who often saythat they cannot find potential candidates with needed skills,0
1,"Community college programs in fields like nursing, technology and even management are designedto give students the skillsthat employers need more quickly than the average bachelor's degree program",0
1,Obama's plan is far from perfect,0
1,It is not a catch-all solution,0
1,other major problems in American higher education still needto be addressed- including for-profit collegesthat consume vast amounts of federal aid dollars but often leave students with little more than terrible debt burdens,0
1,The costs of private and public four-year institutions should not be ignored,0
1,so that the number of bachelor degree graduates will again rise,0
1,And the President's proposal only gives students a discount on tuition,0
2,which is just one part (albeit a major one) of the cost ofgoing to school,2
1,"Yet there is no questionthat Congress should,ifanything,seek to outdo Obama with an even more ambitious proposal, rather than negotiateto reduce his package",0
1,They should not letthis proposal die upon arrival,0
1,Families can't affordto wait through more years of inaction,0

5,"At the time of the last election, David Cameron pronouncedthat TV debates were ""here to stay""",2
5,"It was his confident declaration that:""We will have them in every election in the futureandthat is a really good thing for democracy.""",2
1,Many others thought so too,0
4,More than 20 million people watched some or all of them,2
1,They engaged voters in waysthat we hadn't seen before in Britain,0
1,"To many, it was unthinkablethat they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections",0
1,It gives me no pleasureto saythat I have always had great doubtsthat this was really the case,0
1,"Forit to be true,you hadto trust the Tory leadernot to change his mind",0
1,TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances,0
1,Mr Cameron had demanded thembecausethat iswhatopposition leaders nearly always do,0
1,Nick Clegg wantedto gain exposurethat no previous third party leader had enjoyed,0
1,"In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxiousto be seentryingto connect with alienated voters",0
1,The key was Gordon Brown,0
0,"Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates",2
1,"His people thoughthe had littleto loseand, in a typically Gordon Brownish way,he reckonedhe would come overasthe man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights",0
1,It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected,0
1,whatis most relevant towhatis happening nowisthat it didn't work outasMr Cameron anticipated either,0
1,"The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one",0
1,"presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the ""Cleggmania""that now seems so long ago",0
0,"On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC",2
0,"Among those also presentto comment on the resultswas Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster",2
1,it became clearthat his party had failedto secure a majority,0
1,he placed the blame on the TV debates,0
1,That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party,0
1,"Whetherit is entirely true or not,it has been engraved into the Tory soul",0
1,Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne,0
1,who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues foragreeing to the debates,0
1,The chancellor long ago told friendsthat he is not goingto make the same mistake twice,0
1,"Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates",0
1,"Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chiefwho has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations,is another key figurewho believesit is all downside for them",0
1,The first reasonthat David Cameron and his advisers are against debatesis the traditional one,0
1,He doesn't wantto concede equality of status to his opponents,0
1,The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers,0
5,"The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally:""Ifyou are the incumbent,debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents.It is a rigged game.""",2
1,"It is not,asis often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the rightthat most worries the prime minister",0
1,His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband,0
1,TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunityto secure mass exposure to voters scepticalthat he is up tobeing prime ministerand getthem to reconsider their view,0
1,"So poor are his personal ratings,Mr Miliband might only haveto turn up and string together a few half-decent sentencesandmore people would think better of him",0
1,The hopethat their man could benefit byexceeding low expectationsiswhyLabour is desperate for debatesto happen,0
1,Which makesthe Tories equally desperateforthem notto happen,0
1,"The Conservatives,aswe saw last week with their ""dodgy dossier"" about Labour's spending plans,wantto revert to an old-fashioned model of electionin which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' toursin which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press,to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda",0
1,"So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their powerto prevent TV debates fromhappening at this election",0
1,The broadcasters and the other parties wantedto begin negotiations about the format last spring,0
1,The Tories stalled,0
5,sayingthey wouldn't starttalking until October,2
0,"Whenthe negotiations finally got under way,I am told, and by a variety of different sources,that the Conservatives were determinedto block any progress toward agreement",2
5,"""Atevery stage, they soughtto put obstacles in the way,""says one source",2
5,"Another confirms:""The Tories keptthrowing spanners in the works.""",2
5,"According to a third:""All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives.""",2
0,"Last time around, ""a heads of agreement"" about the debates had been written by December",2
1,"This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that",0
0,The last meeting was just before Christmas,2
5,"""Wedidn't get anywhere because of the Tories,""says one source, an accountthat is again corroborated by others",2
0,I have learnedthat a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone,2
0,It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives,2
1,No new date has been set,0
1,The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates isthat he won't do itunlessthe Greens are included,0
1,I happento agreethat the Greens oughtto be represented in one debate,0
1,"There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendationthat Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as ""major"" parties for the purposes ofallocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens",0
1,They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better,0
0,They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip,2
1,So I agreethat it would be fairto include the Greens - and hoot with laughterto hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron,0
1,Whendid he become obsessed withchampioning the rights of minority parties?,0
1,Who knewhe had such a passionto debate with Natalie Bennett?,0
1,"In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible",0
1,"Byrunning away from debates,the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself",0
5,"Says one senior government figure:""Cameron doesn't likebeing called chicken.""",2
1,the Cameron brand is supposedto be the strong and confident leader,0
1,"whyis he frit ofdebating Ed Miliband, a manthe Tories keeptellingus is hopelessly weak?",0
1,Won't it simply look badto deny TV debates to the voters?,0
1,"Yes, it will",0
1,"the Tories are calculatingthat any fuss will be short-lived, soon forgotten and, in the end,not that many voters will punish them for it,especially iftheir spinners can successfully sow confusion aboutwho is responsible",0
1,The Tories also bargainthat the press won't make that big a deal of it,0
1,"About that, they may be right",0
1,There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaignthat their capacityto shape the agendawas reduced by the TV debates,0
1,There are journalists and editorswho will be secretly happyifthey don't happen again,0
1,I thinkthe chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada,0
1,Could anything change that?,0
1,"Some suggestthat the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threatento stage debates without him - ""empty chair""him in the jargon",0
1,Labour and the Lib Dems hopethis will happen,0
1,Number 10 is assumingthat the BBC wouldn't have the nerve,0
1,the other broadcasters will follow its lead,0
1,holding a debate without Mr Cameronmight anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage,0
1,A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Torieswhenthey wantto project him as the statesman floating above the fray,0
1,A more realistic wayto flush him outwould beto strip him of the Green figleafhe is using as his pretext fornot debating,0
1,The broadcasters could redraft their proposalto include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates,0
1,"Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could saythat they'd be contentforher to participate",0
1,I thinkthey would,0
1,Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen onincluding the Greens,0
0,who have been taking votes off both of them,2
1,"whenit comes to the crunch,they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all",0
1,"Even then, the Tories are so determinedto avoid TV debatesthat they'd most likely concoct another pretext forsabotaging them",0
1,But at least everyone would then be crystal clearwho isto blame,0
0,"Yesterday Sir John Sawers, recently retired as head of MI6, called for renewed cooperation between intelligence agencies and internet companies",2
0,"Meanwhile, European foreign ministers metto strengthen anti-terrorism coordination within the EU,and called for a stronger alliance with Arab states incombating jihadi networks",2
5,"The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said:""The threat is not only the onewe faced in Paris,butit is spreading in other parts of the world, starting from Muslim countries.""",2
1,Better coordination is undoubtedly neededto foil further attacks in Europe,0
0,"whereIslamist terrorists have struck in three capitals - Madrid, London and now Paris",2
1,Anti-terrorism raids in France and Belgium confirmthat the threat continues,0
1,"The Paris killers had links with networks across the Middle East, including in Yemen",0
1,So the needto share intelligenceto counter groupsthat themselves operateand communicate easily across borderscannot be disputed,0
1,A further illustration of this came,0
0,an Algerian national appeared before a Greek prosecutor on Monday over a possible link to a foiled Islamist plotto attack police in Belgium,2
1,It is logical for Europeto reach out to Arab countries,0
1,"The first victims of violent jihadism are, after all,to be found in the Arab world",0
1,"In the Middle East and north Africa, terrorists have targeted Muslims first and foremost",0
1,"It came as little surprisethat the Arab League secretary general, Nabil el-Araby -who has recently met Ms Mogherini- immediately declared his organisation's readinessto help European partners indealing with a dangerthat spans many regions",0
1,"It is, nevertheless, vitalthat such cooperation avoids the mistakes of the past",0
1,This is not a war of civilisations,0
1,It is a fight against a violent sectarian ideologythat finds breeding grounds in Europe's disenfranchised communities and in the killing fields of the Middle East,0
5,"Ms Mogherini is correct to statethat this is ""not an issue between Europe or the west and Islam""",2
1,"But this effort must give proper priority to precautions and standardsthat have, in the past, been all too often trampled upon",0
1,The global war on terror proclaimed in the aftermath of 9/11 involved measuresthat violated fundamental rights and international law,0
1,Western cooperation with repressive Arab states involved rendition flights and the outsourcing of torture,0
1,Many regimes usedrepressive methods and emergency legislation to crush dissent as muchasto track terrorists,0
5,Last month this system of abuses was detailed in the damning US Senate report on the secret CIA programmethat ran detention sites and organised the transfer of detainees with the cooperation of partner countries,2
1,some of which were in the Arab and Muslim world,0
1,Calling for an alliance between Europe and Arab countries in a renewed fight against terrorismis important,0
1,But it should not permit any amnesia aboutwherethis has led in the past decade,0
1,"In the Middle East and north Africa, many regimes continueto show complete disregard for basic human rights and legal procedures",0
0,-asthe recent flogging of a Saudi blogger has illustrated,2
1,"Only one country, Tunisia, can claimto have reached some form of stable democracy in the wake of the Arab spring",0
1,"Others are run by despots or by military juntas, as in Egypt, or have been caught in a spiral of anarchy, as in Libya",0
1,Human rights activists and civil society struggleto do their work under immense pressure,0
1,There are few checks and balances,0
1,Nor is there sufficient oversight of security forces conducting anti-terrorism efforts,0
1,asEuropeans reach out to these regimes,0
1,",they must beware of the pitfalls",0
1,"An alliance with authoritarian powers, madeblindly or naively,can too easily involve the abandonment of values, a dangerous sense of impunity and even indifference towards the worst abuses",0
1,It can also backfire,0
1,becauserepression in some Arab states has provoked fresh discontent and radicalisation,0
1,All these things have happened in recent years,0
1,"This time, therefore, Europe must rigorously uphold its standardsasit embarks on this new era of cooperation",0
1,"This time, the price of mutual assistance must not be a blind eye or a guilty silence about unacceptable abuses",0
1,"BUFFALO, N.Y  - Even a $50 million budget deficit in the Buffalo school district couldn't convince members of the Buffalo Federation of Teachersto cut down on their taxpayer-funded tummy tucks, breast lifts and nose jobs",0
4," school district spending on the unique benefit, known as a ""cosmetic rider"" on the insurance plan for union members, totaled $5.4 million in 2013-14, an increase of 4.1 percent from 2012-2013 and an increase of 9.5 percent from two years ago, according to public records information obtained exclusively by EAGnews",2
4,"As an indication ofjust how muchthe perk is being utilized, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons,the average cost of rhinoplasty is $4,545,whilethe average cost of liposuction is $2,866",2
4,"A breast lift costs $4,207, on average",2
1," over 1,200 Buffalo teachersunion members could havehad a boob job last year, at taxpayer expense",0
1,"The annual expenditure is staggering, given the district's troubled financial situation,not to mention its sketchy academic performance",0
5,"In January 2014, the Buffalo News reportedthat the school district was grappling with a $50 million budget deficit for the 2013-14 school year",2
5,"""Thatgives us very little wiggle roomto fund anything new,""Barbara Smith, the district's chief financial officer, told the school board",2
1,"Except, of course, for a lot of new cosmetic medical procedures for teachers",0
1,"The ""cosmetic rider"" benefit has been offered to teachers for decades and has been scrutinizedonly recently due to the school district's financial plight",0
1,"The school board has been unwillingto impose a new labor agreement without the rider,asallowed by law",0
1,So the district has been operating under the terms of an old agreement -which includes the cosmetic rider-that expired about 10 years ago,0
1,"Untilthe union agrees to a new contract without the perk,the school district will continuepaying",0
1,That possibility has been discussed for years,0
1,the union has never budged,0
5,"""There'sno co-pay (for cosmetic procedures),sothe school district ends upfooting the entire bill,""The Atlantic reported in 2012",2
1,"Perhaps ifthe Buffalo school district produced great academic results, and studentswho were prepared for collegeor the working world upon graduation,taxpayers could justify such a cushy benefit for teachers",0
1,But that's clearly not the case,0
4,The district recently boastedthat its graduation rate improved from a miserable 47.8 percent to 56 percent,2
1,So slightly more than half of the students are now getting a diploma,0
1,which is hardly a reasonto celebrate,0
1,"The district's latest student proficiency numbers are ugly, as well",0
4,"According to the Buffalo News, only 12.2 percent of Buffalo students rated proficient or better on recent standardized English tests",2
4,whileonly 13.1 percent rated proficient or better in math,2
1,So whathas this teaching staff accomplished that merits a benefit as costly and wasteful as free cosmetic surgery?,0
0,"The June 2014 union newsletter - appropriately named The Provocator - includes ads from three cosmetic service providers pedaling procedures like Botox, cosmetic breast and body contouring, facelifts, hair transplantation, and ""medispa"" treatments",2
1,Those ads are boundto pay off for the providers,0
1,becausethe teachers can obtain their pricey services for free,0
1,"- at our expense, of course",0
1,There is a chancethat the cosmetic rider could finally be abolished through labor negotiations,0
0,an outside mediator proposedgiving teachers an 11.8 percent pay increase,2
0,"in exchange they would pay a ""small"" amount toward their own health insurance",2
5,"The proposal also calls forending the plastic surgery coverage,according to the Buffalo News",2
1,"Whilecompletely eliminating the ""cosmetic rider"" from its benefits packagewould not plug the $50 million budget hole",0
1,"the annual expense is an indicationthat the school board is not serious aboutreining in out of control spending, nor making sureevery dollar is going directly towards the education of children",0

1,Last year NFL star Ray Rice committed a single act of unforgettable and inexcusable violence againstthen fiancee Janay Palmer,0
1,"This year he and his now wife Janay hopehe will be back in the NFL, a platformhe has usedto aggressively combat adolescent bullying in the past",0
1,"As the founder of an anti-bullying organization, I hopehe gets a second chance and continues his anti-bullying crusade this year,andformany years to come",0
1,The couple is infamous forwhatwent down in a New Jersey casino elevator,0
0,"Ray knocked Janay out with one left-handed strike,leading to his arrest on assault charges",2
0,Rice was later cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended by the NFL,2

1,a team will have him,0
1,"The couple's botched press conference in May,wherehe failedto publicly apologize to Janay,led manyto condemn him further",0

0,I met with Ray the day before that botched press conferencewhileworking at the Raven's training campto help rookiesandfree agents better handle experiences with high school and college bullying,2
0,"I encouraged him,whenthe time was right,to continue his anti-bullying crusade",2
0,His eyes watered,2
1,becausehe deeply wantsto be a hero to children again,0
1,Whywould an anti-bullying advocate wantRice to have a second chance and to stay in the anti-bullying game under the right circumstances?,0
1,BecauseRay's deplorable but isolated act does not come close to the damagecaused bybullying,0
1,it doesn't makehim a bully,0
1,"We need more people like himwho,onceamends are made,to combatwhatis now the #1 form of child abuse in America",0
1,Rice is even willingto get politicalto fight bullying,0
0,"He supported ""Grace's Law,"" a landmark, anti-cyberbullying law passed in Maryland",2

5,"Also, people within the Ravens organizationwho knewRay well told methat what happened in that elevatorwas inexcusable, yet also did not define Ray's real character",2
0,"Matt Lauer of the TODAY Show,whileinterviewing Janay,saidhe received numerous phone calls from peoplewho know Ray personally",2
5,They also saidthat what happened inthat elevator was an aberration from his usually strong character,2
1,Rice is guilty of a single act of inexcusable violence,0
5,an act Janay saysdidn't happen before and hasn't happened since that fateful day,2
1,"By contrast, most acts of bullying are premeditated, and don't stem from flashes of anger but rather contempt and disdain toward a target",0
1,"Bullies, including domestic abusers, wedpower to fear as part of a psychological campaign of crueltyin orderto dominate, control, intimidate and isolate another",0
0,Yet Janay says Ray's behaviorbefore or afterthis one event includes none of this,2
1,"In nearly a year since the punch felt around the NFL, not one woman has come forwardto accuse Rice of similar abuse",0
1,This supports Janay's statementthat whathappenedwas an isolated incident,0
1,"According to Janay, good may come from this single and deplorable act",0
5,"She told Lauerthat thoughthe claims of serial abuse are false,""God chose us for a reason.""",2

0,The European Central Bank has just announced a EUR60 billion ($69 billion) monthly government bond buying program--Quantitative Easing,2
1,that won't do much for the moribund continental economy,0
1,"Central banks can print moneyto purchase government bondsto push up prices and lower interest rates on those assets and competing debt, such as corporate bonds and bank loans",0
0,"In the United States, the Federal Reserve also bought billions in federally-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, such as those issued by Fannie Mae",2
1,The aim isto encourage more borrowing by businesses and homebuyers--stimulus spending financed byrunning the printing press,0
1,The Fed enjoyed some successboosting U.S  growth,0
1,here are five reasonswhyQE won't work for the ECB,0
2,Eurozone Is Not a Country,2
1,The European Union does not have a large budget and issues few euro-denominated bondsthe ECB could purchase,0
1,"Instead, the ECB will haveto purchase individual country debt",0
1,"it isas ifthe Fed hadto purchase a basket of bonds issued by California, Iowa and other states",0
1,Markets for European bonds--both sovereign and corporate--and bank lending are highly fragmented along country lines,0
1," it is unlikelythat QE will have much effect on banks' willingnessto make new business loans in places buffeted by the financial crisis, like Spain and Greece",0
2,EU Has No Fannie Mae,2
1,QE seemsto work bestwhencentral banks inject capital directly into specific markets,0
0,The Fed purchased mortgage-backed securitiesthat significantly lowered interest rates on mortgages across America,2
1,Housing prices recovered much of the value lost during the financial crisis,0
0,new home construction rebounded,2
2,The EU has no analog to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,2
1,the ECB cannot readily purchase mortgage-backed securitiesto boost the European housing sector,0
1,Fiscal Policy Is Pulling in the Opposite Direction,0
0,"Europe's largest economy, Germany, recently accomplished a balanced budget for the first time since 1969",2
1,"austerity programs intendedto restore solvencyhave forced massive government spending cuts and tax increases in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean states",0
1,Those spending cuts--thoughessential to sorely needed structural reforms--will undercut the effects of any increased bank lendingECB bond purchase may induce,0
1,"With unemployment hovering at about 25 percent in Spain and Greece, and 13 percent in Italy, banks will remain skepticalthat lendingto expand businesseswill do muchto create bigger markets forwhatthey sell",0
1,QE DoesLittle to Fix Euro-Imposed Dysfunctions,0
1,"Althoughstructural reforms could make Greece,Italy and other high unemployment economies more attractive placesto build factories and establish businesses in the long run, governments in Athens, Rome and other capitals face voterswho need jobs now",0
1,And the cost of labor--though perhaps gradually falling--in these countries will remain too highto attract investment for many years,0
1,Mediterranean countries still had their own currencies,0
2,",those could let their currencies fall in value relative to those of northern European states",2
1,That would re-price laborto attract investment and jobs,0
1,"But the single currency, the euro, deprives them of that lever",0
1,"Thoughthe Europeans have a single currency,they lack common education standards and languagethat gives the United States a more or less single labor market",0
1,"In the absence of currency devaluation to re-price Mediterranean labor, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards cannot migrate to Germanywhereunemployment is only 5 percent, with the same easethat Americans have migrated to South Dakota and Texasto participate in the oil boom",0
1,"In the end, the EU and ECB lackswhatthe Fed enjoys--the punch of a national governmentthat ran large deficitsto augment its effortsto pull the U.S  economy outof recession and national credit, housing and labor marketsthat made monetary policies--like QE--reasonably effective",0
1,"The new Republican leadership in Congress has indicatedthat new, punitive measures against Iran might be among its first orders of business",0

1,my colleagues are serious aboutrestraining Iran's nuclear ambitions,0
1,they will resist the temptationto intervene and instead letour negotiators finish the job,0
1,Altering the terms or objectives of the talkswould amount tomoving the goalpostswhenthe end zone is in sight- with potentially devastating consequences,0
1,"November's four-month extension of the ""P5+1"" negotiations (called so because of the participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) confirmed both the difficulty of the remaining issues and the importance ofcontinuingto negotiate",0
1,We are still several steps short of a complete and lasting termination of Iran's nuclear weapons program,0
1,the current interim agreement between Iran and the international community - known as the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA) - is a vast improvement over 18 months ago,0
0,Iran's nuclear program was still expandingand shrouded in secrecy,2
1,the JPOA is only a temporary agreement,0
0,Iran has complied with it and verifiably frozen and rolled back its nuclear program,2
1,demonstratingthat it is willingto take negotiations seriously,0
1,Congress could play an important oversight role,0
1,negotiators workto build on this progress and secure a verifiable and lasting nuclear agreement with Iran,0
1,acting peremptorilyto demand specific concessions from Irancould destabilize the diplomatic balance needed for negotiationsto both continue and ultimately succeed,0
1,"It would be unwise, for example,to lay out unrealistic or overly-specific requirements for a final agreementto be acceptable to Congress",0
1, the nuclear negotiating table is not the placeto compelIran to clean up its act on issues unrelated to nonproliferation,0
1,"Iran engages in an array of behaviorsthat the US and the international community find unacceptable, such aspersecuting political opponents and religious minorities, and supporting terrorist organizations like Hezbollah",0
1,we must not insistthat everything be solvedbeforeanything is solved,0
1,a nuclear agreement is and should be our first priority,0
1,such an agreement could facilitate progress on other fronts,0
1,"Imposing new or less flexible economic sanctions -which has been proposed by a number of my congressional colleagues, including Senators Kirk and Menendez- could do great damage to our prospects for a nuclear agreement with Iran",0
1,New punitive action could strengthen Iranian hard-liners and make their withdrawal from the negotiations more likely,0
1,"Acting unilaterally could also undermine the stability of our international alliance, and thereby actually weaken the existing international sanctions regime",0
1,"The existing sanctions are, of course, a major reasonthat Iran is at the negotiating table",0
1,Congress should stand readyto reimpose and strengthen them,0
1,shouldIran violate the terms of the JPOA or any future nuclear agreement,0
1,taking punitive action nowcould send a messagethat Congress does not stand behind the negotiators,0
1,"We cannot lose sight of the factthat a verifiable nuclear agreement with Iran would makeour country, Israel, the Middle East and the world much safer",0
1,The nuclear talks with Iran could still crumble under the pressure of opposition and distrust both inside and outside Iran,0
1,But the United States and the international community must press ahead ,0
1,becauseof the securitythat the removal of the nuclear threat would bringand the dire alternatives we'll faceifIt is increasingly apparentthat the U.S  war against Islamic extremism has been put on hold by President Obama and his national security team,0
0,President Obama failedto even mention Al Qaeda during his State of the Union address,2
1,"In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse ofwhatthe future of terrorism lookslike,andwhatthe civilized world will haveto defend against",0
1,"At the same time, the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S  partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a countrythat four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led effortsto defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)",0

0,ISIL even has begunto make inroads in Yemen,2
0,"wherethe United States has been involved in effortsto degrade AQAP's capabilities,but have been unableto eliminate AQAP's abilityto conduct attacks on us and our allies",2
1,AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threatsAmerica currently faces,0
1,asthe recent attacks in Paris show,0
1,"In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror",0
1,"But without a change in our strategy, the task ofdefending against the triple threat of home grown extremism,jihadistswho have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria,and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible",0

0,"using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languagesto spread their message around the world",2
1,"They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and tryto portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a meansto attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate",0
1,The United States and all civilized countries needto coordinate our effortsto fight the Islamic State first bycutting them off,0
1,"We must counter their message on social media;bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan;and ensurethat we prevent suspected terrorists fromtraveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen",0
1,"Perhaps most importantly, we haveto helpgovernments eliminate the safe havensthat the Islamic State relies onto gather strength",0
0,"Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failureto learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001",2
1,that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists,0
1,who will eventually turn their attention toward us,0
1,We also cannot affordto ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilitiesthat have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks,0
1,The U.S  government should implore American technology companiesto cooperate with authoritiesso that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communicationsaswe face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more thanwhatthey see on the Internet,0
1,"This year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will haveto extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act",0

1,"Aswe look at this moment in the long war against terrorism,it is encouragingto see Europeans aggressively movingto defend the continent following a horrific attack",0
1,But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraqto see the limitations of President Obama's current strategy,0
2,Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups,2
2,They also do not keepAmericans safe in the long term,2
1,The threat from Islamic extremism is only growing,0

1,we can see your tell,0
1,several of your chosen turns of phrase have been usedto dehumanise and deny representation to gay people for decades,0
1,"""shove it in our face"", in particular,is tantamount to a coded gay slur",0
1,"For that matter, it is not even possibleto ""shove"" heterosexual sexuality in anyone's face",0
1,becausethere is no human on earthwhose faceisn't already completely submerged in and saturated by it,0

1,there have been a stream of warnings about the health of the nation,0
1,"We are swallowing far more sugar, salt and fatthanis good for us- or the public purse",0

1,"It tackles a range of issues spawned by a low-wage economy and refers to the current epidemic of obesitythat, for the first time in many decades, meansthat some children may live shorter lives than their parents",0
5,"On Rock or Sand rightly points outthat ""choice"" in diet is complex",2
1,"It is influenced by income, class, culture and societal pressure among myriad other drivers, not least the seductive practices of the marketplace indisguisingwhatgoes into processed foodand employing the hard sell in honeyed wordsthat are particularly effective on children",0
1,Low-cost food and medical progress have ensured longer lives,0
1,decades with a long-term condition can also bring misery,0
4,The book quotes Department of Health figuresthat show 62% of adultsand28% of children are overweight or obese,2

1,the rise in obesity is reversed,0
4,the cost to the NHS of diabetes alone will rise from ?10bn a year to an unsustainable ?17bn a year by 2035,2

1,It is incrediblethat Merlin Entertainments should considerCoca-Cola a suitable sponsor for the London Eye,0
5,"As this paper reports, John Middleton, vice-president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, says:""Coca-Cola is the flagship for sugar marketing and therefore the flagship for rotten teeth and diabetes.""",2
1,The second imperative is for government to wake up to the scale of the health disaster on its doorstep,0
0,"In February 2010, David Cameron laid out his vision for ""a new age of government""",2
5,"""Ifyou combine this very simple, very conservative thought -go with the grain of human nature- with all the advances in behavioural economics,""he said,""I thinkwe can achieve a real increase inwellbeing... withoutnecessarily havingto spend a lot of money.""",2
1,Money has certainly been tight,0

1,"We acceptthe so-called nanny state edicts on seat belts, smoking and drink",0
1,whycan't the state take a much greater role inimproving the foodthat is sold to us and marketed to our children?,0
5,"Andy Burnham calls this ""finger wagging""",2
1, it is lifesaving,0
1,"It is welcomethat Burnham has promisedthat Labour will legislateto reduce the sugar, fat and salt in foods sold to children",0

1,"The ""responsibility deal""in which businesses voluntarily take actionto improve public healthhasn't produced many results",0

1,It makes sense,0
1,Advertising to children is another issue requiring intervention,0
1,Promoting unhealthy products is restricted on children's television,0
1,"it is unfettered online in ""advergames"" and between 8pm and 9pm on television",0
5,"when,according to Malcolm Clark of the lobbying group, the Children's Food Campaign (CFC), ads are a junk food paradise",2
1,Burnham intendsto ask the committee on advertising practice and the Advertising Standards Authorityhowchildren can be better protected,0
1,That is a cop-out,0
5,"The CFC, backed by the British Heart Foundation, has rightly proposeda body independent from the advertising industryto monitor and regulate marketing to children and tougher enforcements",2

1,"For Armenia, its role as a reliable partner and ally of Russia has never faced any real challenge",0

1,"And with the Turkish refusalto recognise the Armenian genocide,this threat perception is only magnified",0

1,"And beyond an imperative of security, Armenia also depends on Russia as a crucial source of remittances,ormoney sent home by large numbers of Armeniansliving and working in Russia",0
1, there is a surprisingly intense debate now under way within Armeniathat seriously questions these fundamental pillars of the Armenian-Russian relationship,0
1,"More specifically, this new challenge to Armenia's traditional reliance on Russia is driven by two significant factors: tragedy and timing",0
1,A tragedy first triggered this turnabout,0
0,"whena rogue Russian soldier killed an entire Armenian family,save for a six-month-old infant",2
0,"who later died of his stab wounds, in Gyumri, Armenia",2
2,Gyumri is the country's second-largest city and the host of the Russian military base,2
0,"That senseless act of random violence in the early morning hours of January 12, sparked an immediate and spontaneous outpouring of grief and mourning",2
1,But the initial shock and grief quickly turned to outrage,0
1,Russian military officials seemedto take charge of the case with a heavy-handed disdain and disregard for local sensitivities,0
1,That perception was only deepenedwhenArmenian officials were slowto respond or react,0
1,"It was this mishandling of the tragedy,even more than the murder itself, that then triggered a series of demonstrations and protests by local Armenians in Gyumri",0
0,"Fearingthat the Russian conscript would be moved from his detention within the Russian base and likely returned to Moscow,local residents demandedthat the self-confessed soldier be turned over to Armenian authorities",2
0,"For its part,local Armenian officials and the prosecutor general scurriedto calm tensions byfirst announcingthat Armenian investigators were actively participating in the interrogation of the soldier,andthen,oncethat did littleto appease the protesters,vowedthat the soldier would be tried in Armenia",2
1,"Amid the Armenian officials' wrangling over the legal process of the case, the absence of any higher level Armenian officials, and the failure of the Armenian presidentto declare a day of mourning or even make a statement,only escalated the tension",0
0,"And days later,no Armenian official attended the funeral of the murdered family",2
0,"therebytriggering a fresh wave of indignant protests in the city,that later spread to the capital, Yerevan",2
0,The protests soon moved to the Russian consulate in Gyumri beforeculminating in a march on the Russian base,2
0,asprotesters broke through a police cordonto enterthe base itself,2
1, there is a deeper context to this public anger,0
1, that family is only the latest victim in murders and shootings by Russian servicemen stationed at the Russian military base,0
0,"In 1999, two drunk Russian soldiers opened fire on a local market in the city,killing two and injuring dozens of others",2
0,"And in 2013, two children were killed by unexploded ordnance on an unguarded tank firing range on the premises of the Russian base",2
1,"Against this backdrop, the tragedy has also raised renewed questions of base security, with outragethat the armed soldierwho reportedly deserted his posttriggered no notice or alarm by Russian military personnel at the base",0
1,Althoughthis tragedy has prompted a new challenge to Armenian-Russian relations,0
1,"it is also exacerbated by a second factor, timing",0
1,"The timing of this tragedy could not be much worse, for several reasons",0
0," in 2013,in whatmany perceived as Russian pressure on its so-called ""strategic partner"",Armenia was forcedto scrap its planned free trade deal with the European Union in favour ofjoining the Russian-led Eurasian Union",2
1, a steady supply of arms and advanced weapons systems to Azerbaijan from Russia has sowed further distrust,0
1,"And most recently, the negative impact on the Armenian economy from western sanctions imposed on Russia, evident in a sudden depreciation of the Armenian currency and reflected in a steep decline in remittances, has only revealed the asymmetry and lack of parity in Armenia's ""partnership"" with Russia",0
1,It seems clearthat this unexpected challenge to Armenia's reliance on Russia will not dissipate any time soon,0

0,an order came downthat he was notto cover the story,2
0,"The job was given instead to Konstantin Simonov, a favourite of the regime",2
0,who managedto avoidmentioningthat any of the victims in Majdanek were Jewish,2
0,"Grossman, despite warnings from his friend Ilya Ehrenburg, had been slowto believethat antisemitism could exist within the Soviet hierarchy during the death strugglewith Nazism",2
0,But in 1943 he had noticedthat any reference to Jewish suffering was being cut from his articles,2
0,"He wroteto complain to Aleksandr Shcherbakov, the chief of the Red Army political department",2

5,"""Do not divide the dead!""",2
1,Jews were notto be seen as a special category of suffering,0
0,They wereto be described only as citizens of the USSR and Poland,2
1,Thus in a way Stalin was the first Holocaust denier,0
1,his antisemitism was not quite the same as that of the Nazis,0
1,It was probably based more on a xenophobic suspicion of international connections than on racial hatred,0
5,"Soviet propaganda,whiledesignating thosekilled at Auschwitz in collectively anonymous terms as ""victims of fascism"",also portrayed the extermination camp as the ultimate capitalist factory,wherethe workers were murderedwhenno longer useful",2
1,And there was a further twist away from the truth,0
1,"The Stalinists emphasisedhow manyPoles had diedthere to distract attention from their own crimes against the Polish people, both following the Red Army's unprovoked invasion in 1939 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and its brutal occupation from 1944",0
1,They portrayed Auschwitz as the place of martyrdom for the Polish nation,0
1,"Bytalking only of the Polish Catholicswho had died there,they hopedthat the Poles might focus any anger at their bitter fate entirely against Germany and not against the Soviet Union",0
1,Few Poles were taken in during those postwar years of Soviet oppression,0
1,"And now Putin's ill-disguised attemptsto reassert Russian control over Ukrainehave of course reminded the Polish people all too clearlyof whatSoviet ""liberation"" meant for them in 1945",0
1,It is not therefore surprisingthat we should be seeing a certain amount of diplomatic shadow-boxing in the background,0

5,"Most notably, it reads:""...no man shallbe compelled to frequent or support any religious worship,place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced ...in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief;butthat all men shall be free to profess, and by argumentto maintain,their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.""",2

1,Last summer's Supreme Court decision affirming the rightto live and work in accordance with one's convictionswas contentious,0
1,"the High Court reinforced the right of Americansto not just have a faith, but to actually enter the marketplace and practice that faith as well",0
1,"Religionthat is contained only within a church buildingis a weekend hobby, not a personal faith",0
1,Our nation's Founders fled from a regime of religious persecution,0
1,sacrificing their lives to birth a new place of liberty,0
1,"They not only believedthat religious freedom was fundamentalto shape this new nation,butthat religious freedom was a fundamental human right for all",0

5,And that push and pull can be very dangerous to the artist,2
5,"And many artists have suffered terribly for that.""",2
0,The context of Rushdie's recent remarks was the Charlie Hebdo incident,2
1,his outlook was intendedto be sweeping in its generality,0

1,it allows neither thenit is choosingto protect the sensibilities of minorities and others,0
1,whose dignityis under attack,0
1, there are many compromisesthat can be madeto ensure maximum freedom of expression whileacknowledging certain limits,0
1,"The US Supreme Court long ago decidedthat free speech does entitle someoneto yell ""fire"" in a crowded theatre",0
1,This iswhatcourts are for,0
1,"to draw these lines in specific cases, balancing opposing truths in the light of practicality and the evolving values of the community",0
1,Whata judicial body hadto say about race or homosexualitya century ago is different thanwhatit says today,0
1,aswe in the US know too well,0
1,the prevailing ideology among the justices is often of greater importance todetermininghowsuch lines are drawnthanare the legislative or constitutional enactments being interpreted,0
1,"In some respects, then, such determinations are more part of the problem than of the solution",0
1,"I findmyself siding with the abstract sentiments of Pope Francis, but with Rushdie's view ofminimising the role of law and the state",0
1,we impose limits by way of government,0
1,we are entering the domain of censorship,0
1, we needto protect individuals and groups against malicious forms of defamation and hateful attacks on identities withoutconfusing such protection with effortsto channel public awareness in certain prescribed directions,0
0,"My own experience suggeststhat ""freedom"" of this sort has been used by some pro-Zionist and pro-Israeli organisationsto discredit and deterandcriticism of Israel, and especially of Israeli state crimes victimising the Palestinian people",2
1,"In Rushdie's case we needto protect his rightto publish ""The Satanic Verses"",whilecondemning the fatwaimposing a death sentence for blasphemy and apostasy,yet upholding the right of non-western political communitiesto prohibit distribution of such a book because of its provocative nature in certain civilisational settings",0
1,"Obviously, there are no cookie cutter answers",0

1,Some arguethat a decisive approach toward Tehran will be counterproductive,0
1,But their position ignores historical lessons and stands on a number of mythsthat needto be debunked,0
1,More sanctions on Iran will prompt the regimeto unilaterally walk away from the talks,0
1,Iran cannot affordto walk away,0
1,becauseit is desperate and vulnerable,0
1,It has a genuine interestto secure the lifting of existing sanctions,0
1,which provided the initial impetus for the regimeto talk,0
1," too, cynics arguedthat sanctions would promptTehran to accelerate its nuclear activities",0
1,"The regime is playing a game of attrition, aimingto weakenU.S  resolve, win more concessions, and maintain its nuclear infrastructure",0
1,The bipartisan sanctions bill will forceTehran to consider speedy compliance,0
5,"This month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reiterated,""Breakingthe anti- Iran sanctions is the only wayto achieve national progress,""acknowledgingthat Iran's devastated economy cannot endure the weight of further sanctions, especially after the recent decline in oil prices",2

4,more money is being funneled into Syria and Iraqto execute Tehran's designs - a budgetthat is twice that of all the country'spublically funded universities combined,2
1,sanctions failto forceTehran to abandon key parts of its nuclear program after over a year of negotiations,0
1,continued talks with no additional leverage will fail as well,0
1,The IAEA still has no accessto suspect nuclear sites,0
1,its questions remain unanswered,0
5,"IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano saidin November 2014, ""Iran has not provided any explanationsthat enablethe Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures,nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency.""",2
5,Senior U.S  officials have repeatedly statedthat evenwithout additional sanctions the chances forreaching an agreement with Iranis less that 50 percent,2
1,Iran triesto wear out western negotiators,0
1,"clearly, additional leverage from Congress is necessary, not counterproductive",0
1,"New sanctions will strengthen ""hardliners"" in Iranwho wantto sabotage a prospective deal",0
1,This is perhaps the most enduring myth in Washingtonthat has dangerously infected Iran policy,0
1,"The ideathat there are moderate elements in Iran's body politic,andthe U.S  needsto reach out to thembymaking more concessionsis ludicrous",0
1,"The oft-cited dichotomy between ""hardliners"" and ""moderates"" in Iran badly misrepresents a systemwhose elementsare united in their strategic objectives",0
1,"Rouhani,himself a longtime confidant of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,was instructed by the latterto sign onto the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013",0
5,Foreign Minister Zarif told the Iranian Parliament earlier this monththat he has the full trust of Khameneito continue the negotiations,2
1,"Experience has shownthat diplomacy without leverage has never worked with dictators, especially in Tehran",0

1,The greatest social movement of the last century belongs to all Americans,0
1,But some people preferto play racial games,0
1,This movie fits in with the racially divisive discussion aboutwho owns the history of the civil rights movement,0

1,They regularly exploit the history of the civil rights movement for their own personal gain ,0
1,hosting television shows and getting money from corporations,0
1,"whilenot doing the hard work ofaddressing high rates of black crime, school dropouts and family breakdown",0
1,It is also fits with many white politicians,0
1,who blame the poor for every problem and findit easyto push minority voters out of their districtswhileignoring the nation's history ofdenying black peoplethe right to vote,0
1,Now a version of the same race hustle is on display in Hollywood,0
1,"To celebrate King as a hero,the director,who is blackdecidedto make President Lyndon Johnson into a white villain",0
0,"In one scene Johnson erupts inanger at Dr  King,telling the civil rights leader,""You've got one big issue,I've got one hundred and one.""",2
5,"Peoplewho were in the room,black and white aides to the president and Dr  King, sayno such confrontation ever happened",2

1,"To her, the factthat Johnson explicitly endorsed the idea oftaking the movement to Selma in a recorded phone call to Dr  Kingis just a nuisance",0
1,White directors have similarly distorted civil rights history,0
0,"The 1988 film ""Mississippi Burning"" featured two heroes, both white and both FBI agents",2
1,That was an incredible distortion of a story about the bravery of civil rights workerswho daredto go southto stand with beleaguered black heroes against racial oppression,0
1,"In truth, the FBI was often in league with local police departments incovering up racially motivated murder",0
0,In 1988 that distortion was rationalized as a smart box office decisionto offer white heroes to white audiences,2
1,"Now that a black director has a chanceto make Hollywood's first big movie about Dr  King,she sees it as time for payback and her own brand of distortion",0
1,"Race retains a powerful grip on American guilt, fear, lust and anger",0

1,she will twist factsasshe pleases,0

1,The facts arethat mostly white students went south for Freedom Summer,0

0,white government officials like John DoarandNicholas Katzenbach put themselves between racist mobs and black people,2
1,None of this diminishes the contributions of black people,0
1,The truth isthat President Johnson workedto makethe movement a success,0
0,The president famously brought tears to Dr  King's eyes in 1965whenhe told a joint session of Congress and a television audience of 70 millionthat every American should stand up for equal voting rights,2
5,"""Theircause must be our cause, too,""the president said",2
5,"""Becauseit's not justNegroes,butit's really all of uswho must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.""",2

1,"Following the Paris attacks, there appearsto be a consensusthat France has experienced a turning point in its modern history",0
1,Most commentators place an emphasis on the possible roleexternal factors have played in this act of terrorism,0
1,Various external factors are cited,0
1,"they mostly focus on the conflicts in the Middle East and international tensions in general, in a bidto link the Paris attacks to extremist ideologiesthat promote such murderous acts",0
1,"A week after the attack, the French political class and key media outlets remain focused on the security aspect and barely attemptto address the issue from a different angle",0
1,They do not question the responsibility held by French society and state - as well as the role of the socioeconomic policies practised by successive French governments - inaddressing the woes of the socially marginalised and disenfranchised zones fromwhich the Kouachi brothers sprang,0
1,"Howcan this act be attributed only to dogmatic ideological motivations and grievances over international conflicts, giventhat the religious and ideological indoctrination process is too complicatedto be attributed solely to external factors?",0
1,Asboth French officials and analysts respond with emotion,0
1,they ignore a series of socioeconomic factorsthat have fuelled the motivations of the actors,0
1,"It is importantto rememberthat the perpetrators of the attack were born and raised in France in a poor, disadvantaged area",0
4,whereunemployment rates among the youth aged 18 to 24 years reaches 45 percent (compared to the national ratewhich is nearly 10 percent),2
1,"In these areas, called""banlieues"",state infrastructure is almost non-existent and the population is subject to segregation and racial discrimination in terms of access to employment opportunities and housing",0
1,which in most cases leads to exclusion from the civic sphere,0
4,"In 2006, an official case study focusing on access to employment conditions showedthat 51 percent of young French candidates are subject to discrimination based on ethnic origin and/or skin colour",2
1,These conditions result in social marginalisation and promote delinquency,0
1,which in turn raises the chances of incarceration,0
5,"Sociologist Robert Castel describes the situation of young people in these deprived areasasfollows:""These young people are not completely [living] outside of society,however, they are not inside it either,forthey do not enjoy any recognised space/role [...]Their situation is pretty paradoxical:they are citizens,who live on French territory,andyet they undergo differential and discriminatory treatmentthat disqualifies them.The republic, in contradiction with its own principles, seems incapable ofintegrating these young French peoplewho live like the indigenous minority of the nation.""",2
1,"This, combined with a conflicting social contextthat is constantly fuelled by debates over identity,religion and behavioural issues (such as the debate on national identity, the veil, halal food in schools, Islam and French secularism) further stigmatise this community and place it in a permanent state of confrontation with the rest of society",0
1,This vicious cycle prevents any change in the dynamics of this relationship into a cooperative onethat could help find solutionsin orderto improve their socioeconomical status,0
1,"Young people are depicted in a caricaturist form, makingit all the more difficultforthem to socially and professionally integrate",0
1,which deepens their sense of marginalisation,0
1,"Such dynamics only complicate the relationship with the government, often seen as an opponent and sometimes as an enemy",0
1,This is the gapwherereligious indoctrination factors sneaks in - oftenoccurring in prison environments,0
0,whereethnic groups are predominantly from these areas,2
4,where18- to 30 -year-olds represent 35 percent of the incarcerated population,2
1,Are these good enough reasonsto explain the motives behindcommitting such a terrorist act?,0
1,Of course not,0
1,But the conditions described above constitute the factorsthat facilitate and accelerate the ideological and religious indoctrination process,0
1,"Especially whenprotagonists have the financial resources(this is often the case)to attract the most fragile, the most helpless and the most excluded in orderto step forward and enrol in extremist activities",0
1,the international context helps,0
1,"With such a grim reality, the question going forward would beifpurely security measures are sufficientto challenge the terrorismthat threatens France",0
0,"We expectedto find an answer to this question in Prime Minister Manuel Valls's speech at the National Assemblyin which he outlined ""exceptional"" measuresto be taken",2
5,"""Franceis at war against terrorism and against radical Islam,""he said",2
5,"""Exceptional measures will be takento challenge terrorism.""",2
0,"Valls mentioned exclusively security measures, such asreinforcing supervision within the prisonswhereIslamist prisoners are concentrated;establishing inter-European border controls;strengthening international intelligence cooperation",2
0, there was no mention of a possible revision of the government's social policiesto address the problems in the marginalised zones; no announcement of a reflection on a possible serious debateto propose a new approachto address all the socioeconomic illsaffecting them,2
1,"The security measures announced by the prime minister are necessary, but not sufficientto contain terrorism",0
1,"the roots of extremism,wherethe first frustrations are formed,remain untouched",0
1,That is notto saythat the French government should be solely heldresponsiblefor the situationwhich France is facing today,0
1, failingto take intoaccountthe catastrophic socioeconomic factor would be tantamount topromoting the very contextthat contributes to the development of fundamentalist ideologies,0
1,The government urgently needsto review its social and economic policies towards these disadvantaged areas,0
1,"developing real socioeconomic infrastructure, strengthening solidarity, emphasising the fight against discrimination in employment and housing, strengthening anti-racist laws and promoting a fairer media discourse towards these populationsin orderto improve their lot in life",0
1,This will undoubtedly contribute towardssterilising any nicheswhereextremist ideology can take root,0

0,"Yes, I had worries aboutbeing caught but, as farasI can remember,there was no guilt whatsoever",2
0,It seemed like the perfect victimless crime,2
0, we were stealing from chain storesthat had plenty more,2
1,it seems ludicrousthat it ever felt so normal,0
1,Whathappened to us?,0
1,We weren't stealing through need,0
0,most of us got pocket money from our parents and had more than enough clothesto wear,2
1,"Maybe it was that particularly hot summer, or the pressure of our looming GCSEs",0
1,Or maybe we were greedy little consumerists with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement and no moral compass,0
1,Who knows?,0
1,I would liketo saywe came to our senses and decidedto stop,0

1,maybe wages get kept down because of losses due to shoplifting,0

0,"they really shouldn't put them right near the door.""",2
4,"In Ferguson, Missouri, 50 of the 53 police officers are white in a citythat is two-thirds African American",2
4,"In Connecticut's state capital,Hartford, 66% of the police department is white",2
4,only 16% of the residents are,2
1,"And these are just two examples: despite progress over the past 50 years,many police departments remain predominantly white in cities and towns",0
4,wherethe majority of the population is nonwhite,2
1,There are some important exceptions to the disparity pattern,0
4,"Several big city police departments are majority-black or majority-Hispanic (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Santa Fe and El Paso, for instance)",2
1,whileothers (such as Chicago) are so diversethat no single group comprises the majority,0
1,"Yet for many other cities, the gap between the complexion of the police department and the local population is huge",0
1,Whydoes this matter?,0
1,Do police officers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds act differentlywhileon the job?,0
1,Do they have different kinds of relationships with minority communities?,0
1,Aren't all officers trainedto do their jobs similarly and to treat all civilians the same regardless of race?,0
1,"Research showsthat, in general in the US, there is not a strong correlation, let alone a causal relationship, between an officer's raceandhowofficers treatmembers of the publicwhenthey respond to calls from civilians or stop and question them on the streets Statistics",0
1,"are, of course, not predictive of individual behavior",0
1,studies of specific departments or communities vary,0
4,"A 2004 study in Indianapolis (Indiana) and St  Petersburg (Florida) by Ivan Sun and Brian Payne, for example, foundthat black officers were more likely than white officers working in black neighborhoodsto provide information, referrals to other agencies, and to treat residents respectfully",2
4,althoughthe black officers were also more likelyto use physical force against citizens in conflict situations,2
0," again, most studies find similarities overall in police behavior irrespective of officers' racial background",2
1,"Shared training in the academy, as well as on-the-job socialization by fellow officers, results in more similarities than differences among officerswhenit comes to their policing activities,including similarities inhowofficers of all races treat whiteversus non-white citizens",0
1,So we should not view racial diversification on the force as a panacea forimproving police treatment of minorities,0
1,minority officers adopt majority attitudes about thosethey serve and protect,0
1,it might hardly help at all,0
4,"A 2008 study in Baltimore, Maryland by Peter Moskos documented precisely this shared mentality among both white and black officers",2
1,But it can pay major dividends in other ways,0
4,"In one poll of 1,791 Americansthat I and a colleague conducted for our book, Race and Policing in America,more than 70% of blacks, Hispanics and whites in the United States believedthat a city's police department should have a similar racial composition to the city",2
4,The same study foundthat very few blacks and Hispanics (only 5%) want most officerswho work in their neighborhoodsto be exclusively of the same race as the residents,2
4,instead most people preferto see racially-mixed teams of officers patrolling their streets,2
1,"Importantly, such diversity can helpto build trust and confidence in the police",0
1,"the morea police department reflects the composition of the local population,the higher the department's reputation among residents",0
1,"which can provide a foundationto build further trust,coupled with other needed reforms",0
1,"It also helps, in majority-black or majority-Hispanic cities,ifthe chief of police comes from that community as well because, as the public face of the department,he or she can allay suspicions",0
1,whencontroversial incidents occur in a waythat white police chiefs may not be ableto do,0
1,A diverse police force can also helpto decrease the sensethat individuals are being stoppedand questioned solely because of their race,0
1,This clearly applieswhenthe officers and citizens are of the same race,0
1,even encounters between white officers and minority citizens may be perceived as less racializedwhenthe department has a critical mass of minority officers,0
1,"A representative police force can, in other words, have symbolic benefitsthat enhance the overall status of a police department and also reduce the perceptionthat actions, such as stops or searches, are based on racial profiling",0
1,Most police chiefs realize the advantages of a departmentthat represents the local community,0
1,there are big challenges inrecruiting more minority officers,0
1,"Many Hispanics and African Americans are reluctantto consider a career in law enforcement - not surprising, given the history ofpolicing in America coupled with more recent events",0
1,Highly-publicized incidents like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York only makeit more difficult for police departmentsto recruit minority officers,0
1,"Recruiters can have some success,however,ifthey broaden their outreach effortsto include churches and community centers - andifthere are pre- existing positive relationships between the police and residents in those minority neighborhoodswherecommunity policing has already taken root",0
1,which can be built on,0
4,"Althoughtroubled interactions between minorities and police garner most of the headlines,there are neighborhoods in American citieswhereworking-class and middle-class black and Hispanic residents - including youths - have better relationships with the authorities than on average,asI found in a study of Washington DC neighborhoods",2
1,It is in these communitiesthat the police can enhance their recruitment efforts and achieve at least some success,0
1,Racial diversification is one crucial ingredient in a larger program of reformthat is requiredto improve police departments throughout the country,0
1,A representative police force is not a panacea,0
1,"it is a positive reform, and an achievable one",0
1,It is no secretthat Russia views the South Caucasus asbeing in its natural sphere of influence,0
1,"In light of Russia's annexation of Crimea, and on the back of Moscow's recent treaties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgians have legitimate reasonsto believethat Russian activity in their country will only increase in 2015",0
1, many are keeping a close eye on the Georgian province of Samtskhe-Javakheti-a majority ethnically Armenian region located just three hours' drive from the nation's capital city of Tbilisi,0
1,Causing instability in Samtskhe-Javakheti would achieve two goals for Moscow,0
1, it would further dismember the territorial integrity of Georgia,0
0,The Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are already under Russian occupation,2
1,By some accounts they are closer than ever tobeing annexed by Moscow,0
1,"An independent Samtskhe-Javakheti, or one under Russian influence, would divide Georgia down the middle",0
1,Armenian separatism in Samtskhe-Javakheti might not be as vocalasit was only a few years ago,0
1,there is still a fearthat Moscow could easily reenergise separatist movements in the region,0
1,"Secondly, and more importantly for Russia, bringing the region under Moscow's influencewould make a land corridor between Russia and Armenia, via South Ossetia, one step closer",0
1,This is important,0
0,becauseRussia maintains a sizeable military presence in Armenia,2
4,"The bulk of the Russian force is based in the city of Gyumri and consists of approximately 5,000 soldiers and dozens of fighter planes and attack helicopters",2
1,Russia has long had the difficult challenge ofsupplying these forces,0
0,especially sinceGeorgia and Turkey refuse transit rights,2
1,This has left a reliance on Iran,0
1,"which for obvious reasons, is not ideal for Russia",0
1,"It is not only for Russiathat Samtskhe-Javakheti is strategically important, but also for Europe",0
0,"The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the South Caucasus Pipeline,carrying oil and gas respectively from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea,passes through the province",2
1,the possibility of more Central Asian oil and gas finding its way to Europe becomes likely,0
1,these pipelines bypassing Russia will become a vital part of Europe's energy security,0
0," the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway,which is dueto open later this year,passes through Samtskhe-Javakheti",2
1,It is expectedthat this rail line will eventually transport 3 million passengers and over 15 million tons of freight each year,0
1,There is a perfect storm brewing in the region,0
1,Russia wantedto exploit the situation in Samtskhe-Javakheti,0
1,it could not ask for better timing than now,0
1,First is the factthat many Javakheti Armenians have Russian sympathies,0
4,"Until its closure in 2007, the Russian military base there was the single biggest source of employment",2
0,It has also been reportedthatMoscow is issuing Russian passports to ethnic Armenians living in the region,2
1,This in itself is telling,0
0,Russia issued passports to Abkhazians and South Ossetians just before its 2008 invasion of Georgia and also issued passports to Crimeans ahead of the annexation of Crimea last year,2
1,But Russia is only part of the problem,0
1,Many of the grievances Javakheti Armenians have are a result of poor policy making by the central government in Tbilisi,0
1,Many Javakheti Armenians feelthat their culture and language are discriminated against,0
1,There has been a decrease in the quality of education among the Javakheti Armenian population,0
1,"The bilingual education program ofteaching in both Georgian and Armenianhas been described as a ""total failure""",0
1,becausethere are not enough qualified teachers with proficiency in both languages,0
1,Unemployment is high in Samtskhe-Javakheti,0
1,future economic prospects in the region look bleak,0
1,Many Javakheti Armenians travel to Russia or Armenia for work,0
1,Thanks to the drop in the value of the Russian ruble - almost one-third of its value in the past year ,0
1,remittances have also decreased,0
1,The unusually harsh winter in the region is placing a further strain on economic activity,0
1,Then there is the issue of citizenship and immigration,0
0,Many Javakheti Armenians do not have Georgian citizenship,2
0, many hold Armenian passports,2
1,becausefinding seasonal work in Armenia and Russiais easier this way,0
1,"Until recently, Armenian citizens were allowedto live and work inside Georgia without any special authorisation",0
1,they crossed the border back into Armenia at least once a year,0
1,Last September this changed,0
0,Now Javakheti Armenians without Georgian citizenship can only stay in Georgia for three months at a time,2
1,Longer term residency permits are costly,0
1,These policies breed animosity and form a perfect stormthat could easily be exploited by Russia,0
1,It does not haveto be this way,0
1,Sensible policies can be pursued by Tbilisito address the legitimate grievances of the Javakheti Armenians,0
1,The West can makeit clear to Russiathat further meddling in Georgia's domestic affairs could lead to additional sanctions,0
1,The last thingthe South Caucasus needsis another sectarian conflict,0
1,"Whenpeople saythey have no politics,it meansthat their politics aligns with the status quo",0
1,None of us are unbiased,0
1,none removed from the question of power,0

0,They discoveredthat RBC - Royal Bank of Canada - had done something cruel and unusual even by banking standards,2
0,It was obliging junior staffto train a group of temporary foreign workers,2
0,who would then be given the staff's jobs,2
5,"Just afterthe first report was aired, according to the website Canadaland,something odd happened",2
0,"journalists preparingto expand on the investigationwere summoned to a conference call with Amanda Lang, CBC's senior business correspondent and a star presenter",2
5,"The reportersshe spoketo say sherepeatedly attemptedto scuttle the story,dismissingit as trivial and dull",2
1,They were astonished,0
1,"they discovered the following, unpublished facts",0
1, that Lang had spoken at a series of events run or sponsored by RBC ,0
1,"for which she appears, on one occasion,to have been paid around 15,000 Canadian dollars",0
1,that she was bookedto speak at an event sponsored by the outsourcing companythe bank had hiredto implement the cruel practice exposed by her colleagues,0
1,that her partner is a board member at RBC,0
0,Lang then interviewed the bank's chief executive on her own show,2
0,Whenhe dismissedthe story as unfair and misleading,2
1,she did not challenge him,0

1,It amazes methat she remains employed by CBC,0
1,which has so far done nothingbut bluster and berate its critics,0
1,This is grotesque,0
1,But it's symptomatic of a much wider problem in journalism,0
1,thosewho are supposedto scrutinise the financial and political eliteare embedded within it,0
1,"Many belong to a service-sector aristocracy, wedded metaphorically (sometimes literally)to finance",0
1,"Often unwittingly, they amplify the voices of the elite,whilemuffling thoseraised against it",0
0,A study by academics at the Cardiff School of Journalism examined the BBC Today programme's reporting of the bank bailouts in 2008,2
5,"It discoveredthat the contributorsit chosewere ""almost completely dominated by stockbrokers, investment bankers, hedge fund managers and other City voices",2
5,"Civil society voices or commentatorswho questioned the benefits ofhaving such a large finance sectorwere almost completely absent from coverage.""",2
1,The financierswho had caused the crisiswere askedto interpret it,0
1,The same goes for discussions about the deficit and the perceived need for austerity,0
1,The debate has been dominated by political and economic elites,0
1,"whilealternative voices - arguingthat the crisis has been exaggerated,orthat instead of cuts, the government should respond with Keynesian spending programmes or taxes on financial transactions, wealth or land- have scarcely been heard",0
1,Those priorities have changed your life,0
1,the BBC helpedto shape the political consensusunder which so many are now suffering,0
1,The BBC's business reporting breaks its editorial guidelines every day byfailingto provide alternative viewpoints,0
1,"Every weekday morning, the Today programme grovels to business leaders for 10 minutes",0
1,"It might occasionally challenge them on the value or viability of their companies, but hardly ever on their ethics",0
1,Corporate critics are shut out of its business coverage - and almost all the rest,0

1,"Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" has struck a chord with the American people, and didsobytapping into the deepest civic valueswe have as Americans - duty, honor, fidelity, courage, love for country...and a love for others",0
1,no war movie can live on the big screen without a spew of liberal backlash,0
1,this film is no different,0
0,"Criticism has come quickly from Michael Moore, Seth Rogen, former Vermont Gov  Howard Dean and other Hollywood leftists",2
1,"Thankfully, some things speak louder than cowardly tweets",0
4,like the more than $200 million in ticket sales the movie has raked in just one week,2
4," the new war film featuring Bradley Cooper as well-known Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle, is on paceto become the top-grossing war film of all time",2
1,As muchasthe left would likeyou to believe it,0
1,Chris Kyle was not a bloodthirsty warmonger,0
1,"he was a noble warriorwho foughtto defend his fellow troops,watched over the lives of his brothers, and advanced the cause of (eventual) peace",0
1,"This iswherethe true success of ""American Sniper"" comesto light",0
1,"The film is not a movie about the Iraq war, orwhetherwe won or lost;oreven whetherour motivations were justified",0
1," it's a story about a man and the many trials of war, including coming home from it",0
5,"In the words of my good friend and former Army Ranger, Sean Parnell,""[American Sniper] isn't a pro-war film.It's a pro-warrior film.""",2
1,That's the key,0
1,The movie is a testament to the warrior - to the man in the arena,0
1,Everyone criticizing the film is onthe sidelines hurling insults,0
1,"Chris was in the arena,fighting for us in a dangerous and complicated war",0
1," outspoken liberals will continueto cast judgment,sayingthat they support the warrior but not the war",0
1,But they contradict themselves even on that point,0
1,The left sees warriors--men like Chris Kyle--as bloodthirsty and ignorant Americans from fly-over countrywho cling to God and guns in blind support of our military,0
1,They dislike both the warandthe warrior,0
1,Nothing could be further from the truth,0
1,"In reality, middle-America is full of hard working people of faith and fidelitywho love their nation and believe incelebrating someone like Chris Kyle",0
1,"These are peoplewho feellikethey're already taxed enough,that the government is over-bearing in their lives,that religion has been stripped from every aspect of civil society,andthat the president is misguided in his gutting of their military",0
1,"They are, in a word, patriots",0
1,"Despite their frustrations with leftists, middle America is the beating heart of our nation and remains the first in lineto selflessly strap on their boots and defend the very freedomsthat people like Michael Moore useto criticize them",0
1,It's awfully easy for progressivesto cast criticism down from their isolated ivory towers,0
1,"next time they considerdemeaning the warriors protectingthem afar,asChris Kyle once did,they may wantto considerwho protectsthose towers and keeps them fromtumbling",0
1,They're not only the folkswho see this movie,0
1,"more often than not, they're the kind of people depicted in these movies",0
1,"They're the kind of peoplewho embody""citizenship,""and the very idea ofliving and fighting for something bigger than oneself",0
1,Chris Kyle understood that,0
1,Today's servicemen and women understand that,0
1,And that'swhymillions of people are seeing this movie,0
1,"They wantto celebrate and believe in America again, if only for two short hours in a crowded dark theater",0
1,"Pundits agonize over President Obama's resistanceto calling Islamist terror ""Islamist terror.""",0
1,Howcan he not see the obvious?,0
1,Howcan he ignore the overwhelming and ever-increasing evidence?,0
1,Howcan he insistthat his subordinates continue their buffoonish insistencethat Islamist terror has nothingto do with Islamandthat they--secularized Christians and non- observant Jews--knowIslam's character better thanMuslims themselves?,0
1,It's easy,0
1,"President Obama and his commissars fit the longstanding pattern of behavior (insistence, denial, castigation)that the hard left has embraced for generations",0
1,"In the mid-20th century, leftists, bereft of God and desperate for a new faith, insisted for decade after decadethat Comrade Stalin was a paragon of political virtuesandthat the Soviet Union was Utopia",0
1,"All reports of purges, terror, man-made famines and the Gulag were fabrications of capitalists and their servants",0
1,"Even afterPremier Khrushchev revealed Stalin's crimes to the world, hardcore leftists excused or ignored the truth,insisting stillthat Red terror wasn't terrorandthat Communism was a movement (religion?)of peace and progress, that humankind's hope still waited in the east",0
1,Only the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet collapse briefly sobered a few on the extreme left--the milieuin which our president spent his youth and pre-presidency adulthood,0
1,"But leftists needa utopia, a fantasy heaven on earth, to comfort them and to give their lives purpose",0
1,"Robbed of the Soviet dream,the forlorn left was in need of a new redeemer",0
3,"Welcome, Comrade Usama!",1
1,"The left--and young Barack Obama --already saw Islam as an oppressed religion, the noble faith of the wretched of the earth",0
1,casting Christianity and Judaism in the roleonce occupied by capitalist imperialists:that of oppressors,0
1,Bin Laden gave the left a new torchto carry,0
1,it remained necessaryto condemn terrorism in public,0
1,the left simultaneously justified it in a globalized version of the Marxist construct of a class struggle,0
1,"Really,didn't American deserve 9/11?",0
1,Islamism fit the left like a tailored glove,0
1,Just as Western Reds didn't needto endure life in the Soviet Union,0
1,so today's leftwing cadres need not actually live in the Middle East or North Africa,0
1,"From the comfort of Cambridge or the splendor of California's coast, they can rationalize radical Islam, a creedthat would,ifimported here,exterminate them as surelyasComrade Stalin would have purged the old American left",0
1,The staff of Charlie Hebdo?,0
1,"Stalin would have killed those pranksters, too",0
1,"The only difference isthat ""Uncle Joe"" would have gotten them all",0
1,"Whenyou take the long view,it's disheartening(to put it mildly)that the Western left simply cannot live withoutdreaming of an impossible utopiato be imposed by one ideology or another on the rest of us",0
1,Radical Islam?,0
1,"It's a ""religion of peace.""",0
1,"JustasSoviet Communism was an ideology of peace, justice and brotherhood",0
1,"President Obama's just playing by the time-honored rules,substituting Muhammad for Josef Stalin or Mao:Never criticize the Party",0
1,Ignore the facts,0
1,the facts can't be ignored,0
1,deny or twist them,0
1,"No matterwhat,stick to the script",0
1,"(letthem laughfornow,they'll see soon enough",0
1,And anyonewho strays one inchmust be neutralized,0
1,whether asa Trotskyist yesteryearor slandered as an Islamophobe today,0
1,The left's existential bleakness and its resultant needto embracehorrid schemes for man-made heavens on earth form a peerless argument for humankind's need for religion,0
1,In the absence of belief there is only a desert of the soul,0
1,And Red terror gives way to Islamist terror,0
1,The Communist International cedes pride of place to the global caliphate,0
1,Comrade Stalin fades into Comrade Muhammad,0
1,Truth is malleable,0
1,"Facts are nuisancesto be exterminated, along with troublesome people",0
1,Middle-class notions of freedom must be shouted down,0
1,The rule of the intellectuals must be imposed,0
1,"Never, ever criticize the cause",0
1,Deny everything,0
1,Never forgetthat Islam's a religion of peace,0

1,The current state of the US and UK governments' ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week-culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meetingto discuss the issue at the White House on Friday,0
1,Whenit comesto cybersecurity,0
1,it seemsthe UK and US wantto embrace every crazy idea exceptwhatwe know actually works,0
0,The UK's Cameron suggested earlier in the weekhe wantsto outlaw certain forms of encryption,2
1,which could potentially lead to some of the world's most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK,0
1,"That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, withvarious experts labelingit a nightmare for Internet security- on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China- and economically devastating for the British information technology industry",0
1,"Meanwhile, the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial lawthat was usedto prosecuteReddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz",0
1,passed,0
1,"the administration's proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity - for example,potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence forsharing your HBO GO password -all to supposedly target foreign hackersthat the law would likely never reach",0
5,"the Guardian published a secret report based onpreviously unreleased Snowden documents showingthat the US government is fully awarethat encryption is vital for security,andthat the government riskedleavingthemselves vulnerableifthey didn't startimplementing it on their own systemsquicker",2
1,The British government likely knows this too,0
0,many of their employees use email encryption,2
5,UK even recommendcitizens use encryptionto protect their data on a government website,2
1,"At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn't embrace Cameron's proposalwhenasked about it",0
1,even Cameron seemedto at least appearto back off his own anti-encryption proclamation,0
5,"sayinghe's ""not tryingto enunciate some new doctrine.""",2
1,just becauseCameron's been provento be technically illiterateand may be attemptingto publicly back away from his most radical proposal,0
1,that doesn't meanthat he won't later push forward,0
1,FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron's just a few months ago,0
1,Cameron used eerily similar talking points in Washington on FridayasComey did in late 2014,0
1,"Plus, the rest of Cameron's plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban",0
0,"And then there's the White House's so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem,which they unveiled earlier this week",2
0,"President Obama introducedit sayingwe hadto do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command's twitter account",2
1,whathe didn't saywasthat those proposals wouldn't have stopped those attacks at all,0
1,"Part of the Obama administration's proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statutethat the Justice Department usedto threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail",0
0,(Aaron later took his own life whileawaiting trial,2
1,"The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much sothat there's been a movement for yearsto reduce them",0
1,howthe administration thinksincreasing CFAA penalties is goingto worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (ormore likely pranksters)who take advantage of negligent password practicesis anyone's guess,0
1,"It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of peoplethe government shouldconsulting with",0
0," Congress has re-introduced their annual ""info-sharing"" cybersecurity bill",2
1,which is really just a thinly-veiled wayto siphon off more of Americans' private data without court oversight,0
5,"AsEFF put it,the bill ""offered new authoritiesthat could be abused by companiesto spy on users,and offered broad legal immunity fordisclosing the information obtained with the government",2
5,"Sometimes they even granted companies the abilityto 'hack back'...a perfect storm threatening our online privacy.""",2
1,"The President's alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much",0
1,"So, Congress and Obama seemto be finally on the same page about something: harsher penaltiesthat won't reach the hackersthey were worried aboutand invasive ""info-sharing""that doesn't come close tosolving existing problems",0
3,"God forbidthere be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship,orthat both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption",1
1,Even full government gridlock would be better than that,0
0,"On Monday, Nick Clegg pledgedto sign up the NHS to a national ""zero suicide"" campaign",2
0,This comes in a weekwhenI have spent a lot of time talking to the media about depression in an attemptto getpeople to support Calm and the other charitiesthat are doing incredible workto help people coping with mental illness,2
0,"I have appeared on national radio, in the press and on televisionto talk about my story",2
0,"the more coverageI get,the more I ask:why me?",2
1,Letme makethis clear,0
1,I am not famous,0
1,I am not tryingto be famous,0
1,I am a normal lad,0
1,"who made mistakes, lived a lie, and eventually attemptedto take my own life",0
1,I am just another statistic,0
0,Someonewho suffered from an illnessthat took over my life and made mea personI didn't recognise,2
1,There is absolutely nothing special or unique about me,0
0,Yet I am getting calls from people askingme to share my story,2
1,"The factthat I am newsworthy,simply becauseI have spoken openly about the demonsI was facing,makesme thinkthat we are being greatly let down by society",0
4,Suicide is the biggest single killer of men aged 20-49 in the UK,2
1,"It's a statisticthat, no matterhow many timesI say it,continuesto shock me to the core",0
1,"Yet it's somethingthat few people seemto be talking about openly,if at all",0
1,"I get it,we're British",0
1,Sometimes we don't liketalking about thingsthat makeus uncomfortable,0
1,Sometimes we'd rather not ask the questionbecausewe can't handle the answer,0
1,But that simply cannot continue,0
1,It's timethat people are madeto stand up and face the harsh reality,0
1,The fear ofbeing judgedis preventing people fromtalking about their secret turmoil,0
1,"There is very littlebeing done by the peoplewho havethe biggest influence to remove those fears, remove the stigmas,to get people talking about mental health,and makepeople comfortable with the subject",0
1,"The media doesn't just have influence,it has a responsibilityto help communicate a message and set an agenda",0
1,"Yes, things are changing",0
1,it can't be rightthat the furthestwe've comeis havingsomeone receive live therapy onair with Phillip Schofield or a soap character crashing a minibus,0
1,There is too much box-tickinggoing on,0
0,"A petition signed,a campaign joined,an empty promise in an election year",2
1,All very goodbut whatdothey actually do?,0
1,Do they help save enough lives?,0
1,The system needschanging from top to bottom,0
1,"There is no consistency or urgency, despite the high rate of men dying from suicide",0
1,What bigger wake-up calldo you need?,0
3,I would askDavid Cameron to speak up and tell uswhathe is goingto do,1
0,"To meet me,to letme introduce him to the small team at Calm,the volunteers, the campaigners, the people on the end of phones with someone's life in their hands",2
1,Letme show him peoplewho feelas ifthey have nowhereto turn,0
1,"Letme show him the lack of knowledge of some people working in GP surgeries, and the pressurethat thosewho make a positive differenceare working under,asrates of mental illness increase continually",0
1,Letme showhowso little can make such a big difference,0
1,IfNick Clegg is serious about mental health thenhe needsto show it,0
2,It's greatthat he has decidedthat we needto aim for zero suicides,2
1,"I wonder,whatwas the aim before this?",0
1,Just a few suicides?,0
1,A hundred?,0
1,Shouldn't the aim always have been zero?,0
1,"The likes of Calm, Mind, The Samaritans and everyone else, are doing incredible work",0
1,it shouldn't be left to themto do it all alone,0
2,They can only work with the limited resourcesthey have,2
1,They needsupporting and backing,0
1,We needto put faces and voices to genuine experiences,0
1,"Speaking out aboutdealing with depressionshouldn't be considered a ""brave"" act",0
1,it shouldn't be an extraordinary or unusual storyto read,0
1,It should be common,0
2,It should be accepted,2
1,It should be normal,0
1,"whilewe live in a societythat doesn't knowhowto deal with it,and perhaps does not wantto deal with it,we cannot expectpeople to talk openly about such private matters",0
1,Much focus is placed on thosewho are suffering,0
1,"in orderto truly help them,we needto makeeveryone else comfortable and knowledgeable enoughto knowwhatto do,howto act,and know howto signpost people to the helpthat is out there",0
1,We needto be talking about mental illness in schools,0
1,We needto make in-depth training compulsory in the workplace,0
1,"We needto be training taxi drivers, bar staff, hairdressers - peoplewho will find out more about a person through a casual conversationthantheir friends will ever know",0
1,"We needto normalisetalking about the realities of depression,to normalise conversations about the very real prospect of suicide",0
1,it is the only waywe can move forward together,0
1,We need a radical change from top to bottom,0
1,Therapy isn't just aboutlying on a couchwhilesomeone writes down your childhood memories,0
1,It's aboutfeeling comfortable enoughto sayyou're not OK,0
1,"There is someone missing in the now-famous picture of 40 heads of state and government leaders walking in the streets of Paris last Sunday, in an unprecedented show of solidarity with the French nation after last week's terrorist attacks",0
1,We all knowwho it is,0
1," frankly, most of us French people would have preferredto have President Obama or any other senior U.S  government official rather than Ahmed Davutoglu, the Turkish Prime Minister, or Victor Orban, his Hungarian counterpart, or Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister - those hypocriteswhose conception of ""freedom of expression""is not exactly that of Voltaire",0
1,"There is no good excuse for the U.S  physical absence (apart from the presence of Ambassador Jane Hartley,whose faceis unknown to 99.99% of the French population)from last Sunday's march",0
1,Perhaps the White House did not realizethat it would be a historical event?,0
1,"But for most world leaders, the decisionto be present in Pariswas a last minute decision",0
1,It would not not have been easy for the U.S  Secret Serviceto improvise the appropriate security measures?,0
1,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could do it,0
1,don't tell usthat Obama could not,0
1,"Perhaps the president did not wantto support the Charlie Hebdo peoplebecausehe believesthat ""the future must not belong to thosewho slander the prophet of Islam""(his words at the U.N  General Assembly in 2012)?",0
1,Not a good excuse ,0
1,"this was not aboutapprovingwhatthe French cartoonists were doing,but showing solidarity in the face of terrorism",0
1,Obama missed an opportunityto present himself as the leader of the free world in front of the continued menace of jihadi terrorism,0
1,that is his loss,0
1,The mere factthat his presence was apparently not even discussed in the the White Houseis a confirmationthat this administration does not feel as close to Europeasothers did in the past,0
1,we knew that already,0
1,"At the end of the day, I'm not surethat it really matters to us French in the current context",0
1,The debate after the march about Obama's absence became a debate in Franceonly becauseit was one in the United States,0
1,Some in the French government have whisperedthat Obama's presence would have relegated President Hollande to the shadows,0
1,"But most importantly, we received such an outpouring of sympathy from our American friends, Democrats and Republicans alike,that we knowthe United States could feel our pain",0
1,Justaswe felt America's pain after 9/11,0
1," there isabsolutely no doubt that US-French cooperation on counterterrorism,which was already excellent,will be tightenedeven more",0
0,"Immediately after the attacks, Washington offered support from its intelligence services",2
0,The White House has announcedthat it will convene a Summit on Counter-Extremism in February,2
1,that will be an opportunityto devise common strategies,0
1,Maybe the U.S  administration's biggest problem isthat we discovered its embarrassing absence only after the fact,0
1,Is President Obama tryingto sabotage Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run?,0
1,That's one take-away from his feisty State of the Union address,0
0,in which Mr  Obama did three things,2
1, he moved the Democratic agenda far to the left,0
1,whereHillary is not entirely comfortable,0
1," he rebuffed the clear preference of votersthat he work with Congress, bymakingthe cornerstone of his address proposals unacceptable to the GOP and third",0
1,he assured the countrythat our foreign policy (Hillary's foreign policy) is working,0
1,"Americans are not at all convinced,13 days afterthe vicious attacks on Charlie Hedbo in Paris,that Obama's ""broader strategy""is leading to ""a safer, more prosperous world.""",0
5,"Obama sayshe believes in a ""smarter kind of American leadership""",2
1,"for many in the country, the assertion borders on arrogance",0
1,None of these messages works for Hillary,0
1,Mr  Obama's focus on the middle class is unsurprising,0
1,"Lagging income growth for the average American has emerged as the likely debate in 2016, for good reason",0
1,"The numbers showthat during the Obama recovery, the middle class has,asJoe Biden put it,been ""left behind.""",0
1,The issue is valid,0
1,Mr  Obama's progressive approach tohelping average Americans- relying on more taxation and more government programs -- is not,0
0,DespiteAmericans listing job creation as their number one concern for the past six years,2
1,putting peopleto workhas never been President Obama's priority,0
1,He has not encouraged businessesto hire,0
1,"either throughreducing tax rates on employers or byexpanding business opportunities- through trade, or reduced regulations, for instance",0
1, his economic prescriptions have raised costs for employers through the onerous provisions of Obamacare and his effortsto raise the minimum wage,0
1,"As of this SOTU address, he has doubled down",0
1,many of the suggested tax hikes will land on small companiesthat pay taxes as individuals,0
1,ashis proposed sick pay and maternity leave will raise the costs of hiring,0
1,"Such policies have led to labor participation ratesthat are still bumping along historical lows,a crisis in our disability program, and stagnant wages",0
1,A short course in economics might help the White House,0
1,a tighter jobs market will raise wages,0
1,The government raising wages will put people out of work,0
1,It's that simple,0
1,"Obama revisited his familiar theme ofmaking sureall Americans have a ""fair shot""",0
1,"he wantsto raisetaxes to make surethe rich do ""their fair share.""",0
1,He has never laid outwhatthat share should be,0
1,"he has tried hardto convince Americansthat the wealthy don't play ""by the same set of rules.""",0
1,It's a tired song,0
1,Americans have never bought the program,0
4,"A recent Rasmussen poll showedthat 60% of Americans thinkthe country is ""fair"" and ""decent.""",2
1,They don't believethat income distribution is the answer,0
1,"They believe in growth, in optimism, in everyone getting ahead",0
1,"The tax proposals outlined by President Obama are old school, and dead on arrival in the Republican Congress,ashe well knows",0
1,"Congress has indicated an eagernessto work with the president on tax reform,but has prioritizedchanging the dysfunctional corporate tax code",0
1,"The president understandsthat byplacing individual tax hikes first in the queue,he has just undermined any chance for bipartisan agreement",0
1,"And, byadopting the priorities of the left,which emphasize wealth redistribution and also embrace furtherexploiting the financial sectorhe is drafting behind liberal icon Senator Elizabeth Warren",0
1,"This is a slap at Hillary, for two reasons",0
1, Hillary is unquestionably uncomfortableputting on a progressive cloak,0
0,"In the fall campaigns she awkwardly mimicked Liz Warren's rhetoric,embarrassing herself with the head-scratcher ""Don't letanyone tell youthat it's businesses and corporationsthat create jobs.""",2
1,"Hillary is a successful, wealthy womanwho pretends otherwise and stubs her toe on money issues, such as",0
5,"whenshe described herselfandher husband as ""dead broke""uponleaving the White House",2
1, Hillary has difficulty distancing herself from Wall Street,0
5,the Wall Street Journal has reportedthat she and her husband have raised nearly $5 million from Goldman Sachs alone,2
1,It's also awkward for Mrs  Clintonthat the president has burned relations with Republicans,0
1,again,0
0,"In his speech,whiletalking about ""A better politics""in which ""we debate withoutdemonizing each other,""the president also threatenedto veto a number of GOP initiatives",2
1,"Voters have shownthey want the governmentto function -to repair our infrastructure, reform our dreadful tax code,to compete more effectively with our trading rivals,to streamline our outdated government agencies",0
1,For six years Mr  Obama has blamed the GOP forstanding in the way of his programs,0
1,now he will be the obstructer-in-chief,0
1,"From his State of the Union address, it is clearthat he is not interested inpartnering with Republicans",0
1,His aggressive executive actions over the past several weeks onpreventing deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and unilaterally overhauling our Cuba policywere the tip of the iceberg,0
1,Mr  Obama is not into compromise,0
1,"Voters do not like the president's""goit alone""program",0
1,they understandwhythe nation's founders included those pesky checks and balances,0
1,"Obama will makeit more difficult for any Democrattryingto succeedhim to convince votersthat he or she will ""work across the aisle"" - a claimthat Hillary might actually credibly make",0
1," Obama's insufficient resolve against the threat of Islamic terrorism, and convictionthat his efforts overseas are bearing fruit,are alarming",0
1,"Like Muggles fearful ofnaming the fearsome Voldemort,Obama seemsto thinkifhe just doesn't say ""Islamic terrorism"" out loud,the menace will pass him by",0
1,"His embarrassing absence in Paris, his waffle on Syria, his underestimation of ISIS-it all speaks to his pretensethat we have won the War on Terror",0
1,That our president can be so misled and so misleading on a matter of such grave importanceis horrifying,0
1,That Hillary Clinton was the enabler of his cluelessforeign policy is a serious problem for the former first lady,0
1," for the country, should shebe elected",0
1,"In his half century reign of terror, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro committed manifold atrocities",0
1,Documented evidence revealshim to be a ruthless tyrant,0
1,who endlessly abused the most basic of human rights,0
1,-a manwho played a pivotal role inbringing the world to the precipice of nuclear annihilation for 13 harrowing days in October of 1962,0
1,"Beyondhis crimes against humanity and the callous sufferinghe inflicted on the people of Cuba,he ruined the lives and livelihoods of thousands of Americans",0
1,"He stole their land, homes, bank accounts, possessions and businesses",0
1,"He absconded with their property under the guise of ""nationalization.""",0
1,"But he is, in truth, a thief",0
1,Will his victims now be fairly compensated or otherwise see the return of their confiscated property in the wake of America's first steps toward rapprochement with Cuba?,0
1,The answer is both legal and political,0
2,President Obama holds the key,2
1,"So, don't get your hopes up",0
1,"In the first half of the 20th century, Americans and U.S  businesses dominated Cuba",0
1,They accumulated vast holdings of property and operated many of the most lucrative businesses,0
1,All of that ended with the Cuban Revolution in 1959,0
1,"Castro ""nationalized"" U.S.-owned industries and seized much of the island's private property from Americans",0
1,There was no restitution,0
5,One legal scholar calledit the largest uncompensated expropriation by a foreign government in history,2
0,"The U.S  retaliated with an embargo,prohibiting all trade",2
1,But the Americanswho were expelled from Cubawere left holding titles and deeds to homes and businesses towhich they had no access,0
1,Their property rights were dissolved,0
1,any legal judgments obtained were unenforceable against an isolated nationthat refusedto recognize any authority other than its own,0
0,Thousands pursued legal recourse and sought reparations under indemnification programs established by Congress,2
0,Others filed lawsuits and secured judgments,2
1,But Castro didn't care,0
1,"He repudiated the legitimacy of the restitution programs, the valuation of losses and the legal authority of the courts",0
1,"even thoughCuba admitstheir renegade nationalization was, and is,compensable",0
1, does Castroconsider fair compensation?,0
1,"Judging from his payouts to other aggrieved nations,it is mere pennies on the dollar",0
1,do you value dirt?,0
4,"In 1961, the U.S  Commerce Department valuedAmerican property seized by the Cuban government at roughly $ 1 to 1.8 billion",2
0,Nearly 6-thousand claims were legally certified,2
4,Other published reports placed the theft as high as $ 9 billion,2
1,"But the truth is,it's impossibleto know -especially inasmuchasthe value of everything plummeted the momentCastro took control of the island",0
1,Whatwould the same confiscated properties be worth in today's dollars?,0
1,$50 billion?,0
1,$100 billion?,0
1,How about nothing at all?,0
1,"Givenhowthe Castro brothers have driven their economy into the ground,making Cuba one of the poorest nations in the world",0
1,valuation could be closer to dirt than dollars,0
1,Which invites another question,0
1,"assuming a monetary valuecould somehow be devised,howwould Cuba pay for it?",0
1,"With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Castros lost their financial benefactor",0
1,The island is blighted and broke,0
1,it offered government bonds as compensation,0
1,",are they worth the paper uponwhich they are written?",0
1,Howcould they be secured?,0
1,Reclaim the property?,0
2,"Theoretically, it is possible for the confiscated propertyto be reclaimed someday by the original owners",2
1,But that would require a dramatic Cuban transformation from socialism to democracywhereprivate property ownership is permitted,0
0,"In a recent speech, Cuban President Raul Castro insistedCuba would not renounces its core socialist ideals as part of the dealhe negotiated with President Obamato renew diplomatic relations",2
1,some semblance of democracy wereto be restored to Cuba in the distant future,0
1,whatremains of the stolen property?,0
1,No one knowshowmany of the private residencesthat were seizedhave been divided or fallen into decay,0
2,Some may no longer exist,2
1,And what of the current occupants?,0
1,Would they allowthemselves to be kicked out?,0
1,"The same may be true of the many farms, industries and commercial businessesthat were confiscatedand have been put to other uses in the last 5 decades",0
1,"Yes, they have development potential in an open, free market society",0
1," again, the future of Cuba is nebulous",0
1,How realisticis the return of these vast holdings under a continuing Castro regime?,0
1,What Obama should do,0
1,"As a first condition to normalizing relations, President Obama should demandthat all American victims of stolen property be compensatedequitably",0
1,He is already obligated by lawto do this under the Helms-Burton Act,0
1,But Obama has a propensityto ignore or overrule with impunity those lawshe regards as misguided or inconvenient,0
1,This is one lawhe should follow,0
1,A second condition should be the establishment of a commission of judges with legally binding authority to render compensation decisions,0
1,"Several reparation models can be studied and replicated, notably the tribunalthat dispensed claims in post-unification Germany",0
1,President Obama has the power and leverageto forcethe Castro regime to capitulateifCuba wantsto end the sanctions and restore economic relations,0
1,"But so far, he has uttered not a word about a desireto do so",0
1,"whenit comes to negotiations with adversaries,Obama tendsto give away the store",0
2,Nobody can be surewho will govern us after May,2
1,That uncertainty is the great gift of a democracy,0
1,"whata gap between the ideal of citizens interrogating leaders,to decidewhetherpower should change hands,and the arid long campaign this lookssetto become",0
1,"In response to their difficulty incapturing anybody's attention,the party strategists have decidedthat the leaders should mostly tryto say much the same thing every day for the next four months",0
1,British Future's state of the nation poll illuminateswhythat approach might seemto make sensebut alsowhyit won't be enough,0
1,"Half the electorate knowswho they are voting forandwhatthey thinkthe ""big issue"" is for the election - with the committed voters of each party differing onwhetherit is the NHS, the economy or immigrationthat matters most",0
1,The contrast between the certainties of these partisan tribes and the uncertainties of the broader electorate will set the tone of the election year,0
1,"It's not just Conservative and Labour voters,butUkippers toowho think their partywill be in government - orthat Nigel Farage might be prime minister in May",0
1,"Across the spectrum, those with the strongest views overestimatehow many peopleshare them",0
1, the public gives a thumbs-down verdict to every partywhenaskedifthey would like them in power,0
1,"More worryingly, only a quarter of people are confidentthat Britain will come through the election withoutthe tone of the debate damaging relations between different groups in Britain today",0
1,Uncertainty about the democratic outcome is a good thing,0
1,uncertainty aboutwhetherBritain can handle the election-year debatesis not,0
1,"Both the Conservatives, inomitting immigration from their six priority themes,and Labour inadvising canvassersto move the conversation on,have ironically shownthat it is possibleto get headlines bynot talking about immigration",0
1,Running scared from the issue simplymisunderstands public opinion,0
1,Most people want a politicsthat engages with the pressures brought by immigrationand yet secures the benefits too,0
1,So our appeal for an open and responsible debate can be made not just to the social conscience of politicians but to their enlightened self-interest too,0
1,The new state of the nation findings offer an important reasonwhywe might find more confidence in Britain's abilityto handle the immigration and identity debates,0
1,"In a polarised ""culture war"" - between thosewho don't understandwhyeverywhere is not like Londonand thosewho dislike everythingthat has changed since the 1950s- there will be no winners, only losers,whetherthe argument is about immigration, identity or Islam or, indeed, gender and gay rights",0
1, there will be some votes in appeals to either pole of the political spectrum,0
1,but no majority victory nor stable governing coalition could be won on the basis of a political offerthat failsto appeal beyond a party's core support,0
1,Voters expect our politiciansto articulate our disagreements,0
2,We knowthey needto make suretheir own supporters do go out and vote,2
1,But leadership is also abouthelpingus to find the common ground,0
1,"Which of themcould yet find the voiceto engage beyond their own political tribe,to come off the ""grid"" and do more than put out the linethat the script demands?",0
1,"In an uncertain and fractious society, there is a greater appetite for politicians with the confidenceto speak to people of different generations, to engage in both the cities and out on the coast, and to reach across class, geography and ethnicity",0
1,Will anyone step upto meet that challenge in the next three months?,0
1,"If not,that could still be the voicethat much of Britain is waitingto hear",0

1,President Obama sure is consistent,0
1,His State of the Union address sounded like his other speeches,0
1,WhatI've doneis great!,0
1,America is in a much better position,0
0,We've created a manufacturing sectorthat's adding jobs,2
0,More oil is produced at home,2
1,I cut deficits in half!,0
1,Give me a break,0
1,The deficit is lower now not because of any prudence on Obama's part butmerely becausethe $800 billion stimulus spending blowout didn't continue,0
1,All the president doesis increase spending,0
1,"freecommunity college, free Obamaphones, free birth control, etc",0
4,"Yes, our annual deficit is lower",2
4,it's still $488 billion!,2
4,Our $18 trillion national debt increases by $3 million every minute!,2
4,"Yes, more oil is produced at home",2
1,that's in spite of the administration,0
4,Oil production is down on public land,2
4,"Yes, the manufacturing sector added jobs",2
1,that's mostly because of cheaper natural gas created by fracking,0
1,which Obama's cronies opposed,0
1, America is finally recovering from recession,0
1,Obama's policies probably slowed that recovery,0
1,"Does the President delude himselfwhenhe takes credit for oil production, lower deficits, etc.?",0
1,Or does he mislead on purpose?,0
3,I don't know,1
5,"More recentlyhe bragged,""I created the lowest unemployment rate in years.""",2
1,He created it?,0
1,"He must knowit's ""low"" only compared to the 10 percent reached during the recession ",0
1,becausemillions have simply given uplooking for work,0
1,This recovery is the slowest in 70 years,0
1,Obama gave the State of the Union addressI'd liketo hear,0
1,he'd say this,0
1,"I heard you, voters, in Novemberwhenyou took control of the Senate away from my party",0
1,I get it,0
1,I overreached,0
1,I was arrogant,0
1,I imposed Obamacare on a nationthat was deeply divided about it,0
1,I ruled through executive orders instead of legislation,0
1,"I threw money at ""green"" nonsense",0
1,"I'll give up the payments to the ""green energy"" industryifthe Republicans stop coddling defense contractors",0
0,I've been in government for years now,2
1,I knowhow badlyit works,0
1,The last thingI should tryto dois makeit bigger,0
1," with Republicans now in control of Congress, it's timeI worked with themto shrink government",0
1,we shrink itwe might even dig our way out of the debt holewe're in,0
1,we just slow the growth of government to 2 percent a year,0
1,we'd be in better shape,0
1,But I didn't even tryto accomplish that,0
1,I pretendedtaxing the richwould solve our financial problems,0
1,But there aren't enough rich people to tax,0
1,"I got drunk on the idea of promising voters ""free"" stuff such as low down- payment mortgages and guaranteed paid family leave",0
1,I told themthat all good things come from government,0
1,That's nonsense,0
1,We should put an end to all bailouts,0
1,"Businesses that screw up should accept the consequences, just like ordinary peoplewho spend recklessly",0
1,Main Street should never again be forcedto rescue Wall Street,0
1,"Instead ofexpanding government control of health care,we should phase it out",0
1,That includes Medicare,0
1,I knowMedicare is popular,0
1,it is unsustainable,0
1,Letcurrent retirees receive their benefits aspromised,0
1,younger people should pay for their own health care,0
1,People criticize the economic distortion created by welfare,0
1,Medicare and Social Security are almost as bad,0
1,Both redistribute money away from the young and struggling toward those of uswho have had decadesto investand save up,0
1,"To makethese challenges a little easierto deal with,let's makeAmerica richer byabolishing most regulations",0
1,They strangle opportunity,0
1,"The moreI think about it,the more Congress and I could transform America for the better just bygetting out of America's way",0
1,The state of our union will be truly strongifthe state -- bywhich I mean government-- is strictly limited,0

1,Here's a prediction: expect a narrativeto emerge in certain media outlets in the coming daysthat Tuesday night's State of the Union speech was a grand returnto form for President Obama,0
1,"The elite, east-coast intelligencia line will bethat the beleaguered lame duck president--facing a hostile, conservative Congress--regained his momentum with renewed energy and purpose",0
1,HowObama Got His Groove Back,0
1,the fact remainsthat Obama's next-to-last State of the Union address did not substantially address two of the most pressing issues currently facing our nation and that matter most to its military veterans: the lack of a clear United States national security strategy--to include the crisis facing our military--and the inability of the VA bureaucracy careto deliver timely health care to millions of our veterans,0
1,But you wouldn't know it bylistening to Tuesday night's State of the Union address,0
1,President Obama is living in a fantasy world,0
5,"The president saysthat we're ""stopping ISIL's advance.""",2
1,"in reality, his campaign of airstrikes have not been successful",0
1,ISIS controls more territory in Iraq and Syria today than ever before,0
5,"He also boldly claimedthat ""we're slashing the backlogthat had too many veteranswaiting yearsto get the benefitsthey need,""",2
1,this statement too just doesn't match up with reality,0
4,"Today, nearly 250,000 veterans are still stuck in the VA claims backlog and another 290,000 languish in the appeals process",2
1,"Is that still ""too many,"" Mr  President?",0
1,Unfortunate events will likely force the president's attention to these issues in 2015,0
1,ISIS didinIraq and Phoenix did for the VA in 2014,0
1, President Obama could be proactive and get ahead of these issues bypursuing the following four agenda items,0
1,Articulate a real national security strategy,0
1,"The president's plan for""leading from behind""--and thatnational security and foreign policy boils down to ""don't do stupid stuff""--is no substitute for a real strategy,asdeteriorating situations in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and elsewhere prove",0
1,"Likewise, denying the nature of the enemywe face(""ISIS is not Islamic"")only muddies the water further",0
1,emboldening our enemies and confusing our allies,0
0,President Obama also toutedending the 14 year-long war in Afghanistan,2
1,"""ending""is different than""winning.""",0
1,His telegraphed withdrawals have pulled us out of conflictsbeforethey're resolved,0
1,creating power vacuums in Iraq- and soon in Afghanistan-that leaveAmerica more vulnerable,0
0,"And incredibly, for the first time since 9/11, the president failedto even mention the Taliban or Al Qaeda ",2
1,"both of which are far from ""on the run""ashe proclaimed in 2012 and are advancing and actively challenging the West",0
1,Get serious aboutfixing defense spending,0
1,"Instead ofcutting fat,the president's ill-conceived defense budget sequester has slashed into the muscle of our military force",0
1,"The administration should striveto replace defense sequestration, byimplementing serious and commensurate acquisitions and compensation reforms",0
1,"Reforming these areas will reduce Pentagon budgetary pressures caused by massive weapons system cost-overruns and exploding personnel costs, allowing for a more strategic allocation of war-fighting resources",0
1,"In orderto live within a fiscally responsible reality, and most importantly maintain the world's most capable military,the administration and Congress must get serious about real DoD spending reform",0
0,His address last night didn't even mention sequestration,2
1,Develop and implement a planto tackle the national debt,0
1,"Respected military leaders like Marine General James Mattis, Admiral Mike Mullen, and many others recognizethat the biggest long-term threat to our national security is our massive national debt",0
1,"At more than $18 trillion and growing, the debt is on trackto double under President Obama",0
1,"It is absolutely vital to the fiscal, economic, and military strength of our countrythat we have a serious planto get our debt under control through reductions in spending and significant reforms across the government",0
1,Implement more accountability and choice at the VA,0
1,"The VA reforms passed by Congress last yearwere a good first step, but will not address the deeper, systemic culture problems at VA",0
1,"In the next Congress, the president should champion even deeper reforms at VAto bring accountability for poor performing employees throughout the department and to expand health care options for veterans outside the VA system",0
1,"These basic principles would not only address a campaign promisethe president has failedto deliver on(""fixing the VA"")but would showthat he is finally serious aboutimproving veterans' access to the quality health carethey earned",0
1,"Whatthe president misses, and even defies,in his latest list of proposals isthat Americans don't think governmentisn't doing enough",0
1,"They thinkgovernment does too much,that most of whatit does,it does poorly",0
1,that it doesn't attend to the issuesthat matter to them,0
1,Focusing on the four agenda itemsabove would send a messagethat the president is finally serious aboutgoverning in his last two years in office,0
1,It's probably too muchto ask for Obamato change his approach at this stage in his presidency,0
1,"it's essentialifhe wantsto avoid a legacy of division, defiance and neglect",0
1,the president continues on his current course?,0
1,"Well, the items listed above will become part of a compelling agenda for his potential successors",0
1,they take to the campaign trail for 2016,0
